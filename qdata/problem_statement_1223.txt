A. The Ultimate Squaretime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have $$$n$$$ rectangular wooden blocks, which are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th block is $$$1$$$ unit high and $$$\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil$$$ units long.Here, $$$\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil$$$ denotes the result of division of $$$x$$$ by $$$2$$$, rounded up. For example, $$$\lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2$$$ and $$$\lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = \lceil 2.5 \rceil = 3$$$.For example, if $$$n=5$$$, then the blocks have the following sizes: $$$1 \times 1$$$, $$$1 \times 1$$$, $$$1 \times 2$$$, $$$1 \times 2$$$, $$$1 \times 3$$$.  The available blocks for $$$n=5$$$ Find the maximum possible side length of a square you can create using these blocks, without rotating any of them. Note that you don't have to use all of the blocks.  One of the ways to create $$$3 \times 3$$$ square using blocks $$$1$$$ through $$$5$$$ InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$) — the number of blocks.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible side length of a square you can create.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, you can create a $$$1 \times 1$$$ square using only one of the blocks.In the second test case, one of the possible ways to create a $$$3 \times 3$$$ square is shown in the statement. It is impossible to create a $$$4 \times 4$$$ or larger square, so the answer is $$$3$$$.
