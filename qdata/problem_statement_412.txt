Calculate the number of subarrays of this array $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$, such that: The array $$$b = [a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r]$$$ occurs in the array $$$a$$$ as a subsequence exactly once. In other words, there is exactly one way to select a set of indices $$$1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_{r - l + 1} \leq n$$$, such that $$$b_j = a_{i_j}$$$ for all $$$1 \leq j \leq r - l + 1$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by their description.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the number of suitable subarrays.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, there is exactly one subarray $$$(1, 1)$$$ that suits us.In the second test case, there is exactly one subarray $$$(1, 2)$$$ that suits us. Subarrays $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(2, 2)$$$ do not suit us, as the subsequence $$$[1]$$$ occurs twice in the array.In the third test case, all subarrays except $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(3, 3)$$$ are suitable.
