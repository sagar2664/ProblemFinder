A. Almost Increasing Subsequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA sequence is almost-increasing if it does not contain three consecutive elements $$$x, y, z$$$ such that $$$x\ge y\ge z$$$.You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries.Each query consists of two integers $$$1\le l\le r\le n$$$. For each query, find the length of the longest almost-increasing subsequence of the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$$$. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.InputThe first line of input contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, q \leq 200\,000$$$)  — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$)  — the values of the array $$$a$$$.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains the description of a query. Each line contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$)  — the query is about the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$$$.OutputFor each of the $$$q$$$ queries, print a line containing the length of the longest almost-increasing subsequence of the subarray $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first query, the subarray is $$$a_1, a_2, a_3 = [1,2,4]$$$. The whole subarray is almost-increasing, so the answer is $$$3$$$.In the second query, the subarray is $$$a_1, a_2, a_3,a_4 = [1,2,4,3]$$$. The whole subarray is a almost-increasing, because there are no three consecutive elements such that $$$x \geq y \geq z$$$. So the answer is $$$4$$$.In the third query, the subarray is $$$a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 = [2, 4, 3, 3]$$$. The whole subarray is not almost-increasing, because the last three elements satisfy $$$4 \geq 3 \geq 3$$$. An almost-increasing subsequence of length $$$3$$$ can be found (for example taking $$$a_2,a_3,a_5 = [2,4,3]$$$ ). So the answer is $$$3$$$.
