You can perform the following operation multiple times:  select an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) such that $$$a_i=0$$$;  then replace $$$a_i$$$ by an arbitrary integer.  What is the maximum possible score of $$$a$$$ that can be obtained by performing a sequence of such operations?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum possible score of the array $$$a$$$ after performing a sequence of operations.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, it is optimal to change the value of $$$a_2$$$ to $$$-2$$$ in one operation.The resulting array $$$a$$$ will be $$$[2,-2,1,-1,0]$$$, with a score of $$$3$$$:  $$$a_1+a_2=2-2=0$$$;  $$$a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4=2-2+1-1=0$$$;  $$$a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5=2-2+1-1+0=0$$$. In the second test case, it is optimal to change the value of $$$a_3$$$ to $$$-2\,000\,000\,000$$$, giving us an array with a score of $$$1$$$.In the third test case, it is not necessary to perform any operations.
