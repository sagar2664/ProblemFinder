I. Inverse Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider the following problem.You are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters, and an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$n$$$ is not divisible by $$$k$$$). Each letter is one of the first $$$c$$$ letters of the alphabet.You apply the following operation until the length of the string is less than $$$k$$$: choose a contiguous substring of the string of length exactly $$$k$$$, remove it from the string and glue the resulting parts together without changing the order.Let the resulting string of length smaller than $$$k$$$ be $$$t$$$. What is lexicographically smallest string $$$t$$$ that can obtained?You are asked the inverse of this problem. Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$n$$$ is not divisible by $$$k$$$) and a string $$$t$$$, consisting of ($$$n \bmod k$$$) lowercase Latin letters, count the number of strings $$$s$$$ that produce $$$t$$$ as the lexicographically smallest solution.Print that number modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n, k$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$; $$$2 \le k \le 10^6$$$; $$$1 \le c \le 26$$$; $$$n$$$ is not divisible by $$$k$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$, the length of the substring that is being removed and the number of first letters from the alphabet.The second line contains string $$$t$$$, consisting of exactly ($$$n \bmod k$$$) lowercase Latin letters. Each letter is one of the first $$$c$$$ letters of the alphabet.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of strings $$$s$$$ that produce $$$t$$$ as the lexicographically smallest solution.ExamplesInput
