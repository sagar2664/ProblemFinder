A. Hayato and Schooltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToday Hayato came home from school with homework.In the assignment, Hayato was given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The task was to find $$$3$$$ numbers in this array whose sum is odd. At school, he claimed that there are such $$$3$$$ numbers, but Hayato was not sure, so he asked you for help.Answer if there are such three numbers, and if so, output indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, and $$$k$$$ such that $$$a_i + a_j + a_k$$$ is odd.The odd numbers are integers that are not divisible by $$$2$$$: $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$, and so on.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.For each test case, the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 300$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^5$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, in the first line print one word "YES" (without quotes) if there are $$$3$$$ numbers with an odd sum or "NO" (without quotes) if there are no such $$$3$$$ numbers.If the answer exists, then on the second line print $$$3$$$ distinct integers $$$i, j, k$$$ ($$$1 \le i, j, k \le n$$$) — the indices of the numbers. If there are several answers, output any.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, there is one way to choose $$$3$$$ numbers, and since $$$1 + 1 + 1 = 3$$$, this triple is fine for us.In the second test case, you need to choose the numbers $$$1, 2, 2$$$, since $$$1 + 2 + 2 = 5$$$.In the third test case, there is one way to choose three numbers, but $$$1 + 2 + 3 = 6$$$ is an even number, so the required triple does not exist.In the fifth test case, no matter what three numbers we choose, their sum is even.
