H. Expected Twisttime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem.There is an array $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers hidden from you. Your task is to find the smallest element of the array.To do this, you can ask several queries. In each query, you can pick two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$). In return, you will be given the value of $$$\max(a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r)$$$. In other words, you will be told the maximum value of the subarray from $$$a_l$$$ to $$$a_r$$$.Find the minimum of the array. You can ask at most $$$\mathbf{624}$$$ queries.It is guaranteed that the values $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ are chosen uniformly at random between $$$0$$$ and $$$2^{32}-1$$$ (inclusive).InteractionBegin the interaction by reading an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^4$$$) on a separate line.To ask a query, print a line in the form $$$\texttt{?}\;\;l\;\;r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$). Then you should read a single line containing the answer to your query.After you have determined the answer, print a line in the form $$$\texttt{!}\;\;x$$$ where $$$x$$$ is the minimum value.After printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:  fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;  System.out.flush() in Java;  flush(output) in Pascal;  stdout.flush() in Python;  see the documentation for other languages. Answer $$$\texttt{-1}$$$ means that you made an invalid query. Exit immediately after receiving $$$\texttt{-1}$$$ and you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.ExampleInput
