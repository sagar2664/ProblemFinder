E. Weird LCM Operationstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven an integer $$$n$$$, you construct an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, where $$$a_i = i$$$ for all integers $$$i$$$ in the range $$$[1, n]$$$. An operation on this array is defined as follows:  Select three distinct indices $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, and $$$k$$$ from the array, and let $$$x = a_i$$$, $$$y = a_j$$$, and $$$z = a_k$$$.  Update the array as follows: $$$a_i = \operatorname{lcm}(y, z)$$$, $$$a_j = \operatorname{lcm}(x, z)$$$, and $$$a_k = \operatorname{lcm}(x, y)$$$, where $$$\operatorname{lcm}$$$ represents the least common multiple.  Your task is to provide a possible sequence of operations, containing at most $$$\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5$$$ operations such that after executing these operations, if you create a set containing the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of all subsequences with a size greater than $$$1$$$, then all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ should be present in this set.After all the operations $$$a_i \le 10^{18}$$$ should hold for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$.We can show that an answer always exists.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^2$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^{4}$$$) — the length of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^{4}$$$.OutputThe first line should contain an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5$$$) — where $$$k$$$ is the number of operations.The next $$$k$$$ lines should contain the description of each operation i.e. $$$3$$$ integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ and $$$k$$$, where $$$1 \leq i, j, k \leq n$$$ and all must be distinct.ExampleInput
