In one operation you do the following:   Choose any integer $$$x$$$.  For all $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i = x$$$, do $$$a_i := 0$$$ (assign $$$0$$$ to $$$a_i$$$). Find the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, you can choose $$$x = 3$$$ for the operation, the resulting array is $$$[0, 0, 2]$$$.In the second test case, you can choose $$$x = 1$$$ for the first operation and $$$x = 3$$$ for the second operation, the resulting array is $$$[0, 0, 0, 0]$$$.
