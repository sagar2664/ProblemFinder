L. Prime Divisors Selectiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSuppose you have a sequence of $$$k$$$ integers $$$A = [a_1, a_2, \dots , a_k]$$$ where each $$$a_i \geq 2$$$. A sequence of prime integers $$$P = [p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k]$$$ is called suitable for the sequence $$$A$$$ if $$$a_1$$$ is divisible by $$$p_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$ is divisible by $$$p_2$$$ and so on. A sequence of prime integers $$$P$$$ is called friendly if there are no unique integers in this sequence. A sequence $$$A$$$ is called ideal, if each sequence $$$P$$$ that is suitable for $$$A$$$ is friendly as well (i. e. there is no sequence $$$P$$$ that is suitable for $$$A$$$, but not friendly). For example, the sequence $$$[2, 4, 16]$$$ is ideal, while the sequence $$$[2, 4, 6]$$$ is not ideal (there exists a sequence $$$P = [2, 2, 3]$$$ which is suitable for $$$A$$$, but not friendly).You are given $$$n$$$ different integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, ..., $$$x_n$$$. You have to choose exactly $$$k$$$ of them in such a way that they form an ideal sequence, or report that it is impossible. Note that no integer can be chosen more than once.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, ..., $$$x_n$$$ ($$$2 \leq x_i \leq 10^{18}$$$).OutputIf it is impossible to choose exactly $$$k$$$ integers from $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, ..., $$$x_n$$$ in such a way that the chosen integers form an ideal sequence, print $$$0$$$.Otherwise, print $$$k$$$ pairwise distinct integers — the elements of the chosen ideal sequence. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput3 32 4 6Output0Input3 32 4 16Output2 4 16 Input4 32 4 6 16Output2 4 16
