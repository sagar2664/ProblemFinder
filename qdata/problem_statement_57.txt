B. Bessie and MEXtime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMOOO! - Doja Cat⠀Farmer John has a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$, where every integer from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and challenges her to construct $$$p$$$ based on $$$a$$$. The array $$$a$$$ is constructed so that $$$a_i$$$ = $$$\texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i$$$, where the $$$\texttt{MEX}$$$ of an array is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in that array. For example, $$$\texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0$$$ and $$$\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2$$$.Help Bessie construct any valid permutation $$$p$$$ that satisfies $$$a$$$. The input is given in such a way that at least one valid $$$p$$$ exists. If there are multiple possible $$$p$$$, it is enough to print one of them.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the lengths of $$$p$$$ and $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-n \leq a_i \leq n$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid $$$p$$$ for the given data.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers on a new line, the elements of $$$p$$$.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first case, $$$p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]$$$ is one possible output.$$$a$$$ will then be calculated as $$$a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1$$$, $$$a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1$$$, $$$a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2$$$, $$$a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1$$$, $$$a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2$$$.So, as required, $$$a$$$ will be $$$[1, 1, -2, 1, 2]$$$.
