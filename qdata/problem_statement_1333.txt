E. Maximums and Minimumstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of positive integers.Find the number of pairs of indices $$$(l, r)$$$, where $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$, that pass the check. The check is performed in the following manner:   The minimum and maximum numbers are found among $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$.  The check is passed if the maximum number is divisible by the minimum number. InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.Each test case consists of two lines.The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^6$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the number of pairs of indices that pass the check.ExampleInput

NoteBelow $$$x \mid y$$$ denotes that $$$y$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$.In the first test case, there is one pair $$$(1, 1)$$$, the maximum for this pair is $$$1$$$, the minimum is also $$$1$$$, $$$1 \mid 1$$$, so the check is passed, and the answer is $$$1$$$.In the second test case, there are $$$3$$$ segments:   $$$(1, 1)$$$: the maximum is $$$2$$$, the minimum is $$$2$$$, $$$2 \mid 2$$$, so the check is passed.  $$$(1, 2)$$$: the maximum is $$$4$$$, the minimum is $$$2$$$, $$$2 \mid 4$$$, so the check is passed.  $$$(2, 2)$$$: the maximum is $$$4$$$, the minimum is $$$4$$$, $$$4 \mid 4$$$, so the check is passed. In the third test case, there are $$$3$$$ segments:   $$$(1, 1)$$$: the maximum is $$$2$$$, the minimum is $$$2$$$, $$$2 \mid 2$$$, so the check is passed.  $$$(1, 2)$$$: the maximum is $$$3$$$, the minimum is $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ isn't divisible by $$$2$$$, so the check is failed.  $$$(2, 2)$$$: the maximum is $$$3$$$, the minimum is $$$3$$$, $$$3 \mid 3$$$, so the check is passed.
