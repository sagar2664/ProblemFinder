A. Forbidden Subsequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given strings $$$S$$$ and $$$T$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that $$$T$$$ is a permutation of the string abc. Find string $$$S'$$$, the lexicographically smallest permutation of $$$S$$$ such that $$$T$$$ is not a subsequence of $$$S'$$$.String $$$a$$$ is a permutation of string $$$b$$$ if the number of occurrences of each distinct character is the same in both strings.A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \ne b$$$; in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a string $$$S$$$ ($$$1 \le |S| \le 100$$$), consisting of lowercase English letters.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$T$$$ that is a permutation of the string abc. (Hence, $$$|T| = 3$$$).Note that there is no limit on the sum of $$$|S|$$$ across all test cases.OutputFor each test case, output a single string $$$S'$$$, the lexicographically smallest permutation of $$$S$$$ such that $$$T$$$ is not a subsequence of $$$S'$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, both aaaabbc and aaaabcb are lexicographically smaller than aaaacbb, but they contain abc as a subsequence.In the second test case, abccc is the smallest permutation of cccba and does not contain acb as a subsequence.In the third test case, bcdis is the smallest permutation of dbsic and does not contain bac as a subsequence.
