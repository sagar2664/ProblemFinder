F1. Anti-median (Easy Version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $$$n$$$. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.Let's call an array $$$a$$$ of odd length $$$2m+1$$$ (with $$$m \ge 1$$$) bad, if element $$$a_{m+1}$$$ is equal to the median of this array. In other words, the array is bad if, after sorting it, the element at $$$m+1$$$-st position remains the same.Let's call a permutation $$$p$$$ of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ anti-median, if every its subarray of odd length $$$\ge 3$$$ is not bad.You are already given values of some elements of the permutation. Find the number of ways to set unknown values to obtain an anti-median permutation. As this number can be very large, find it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \le n \le 1000)$$$  — the length of the permutation.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$, or $$$p_i = -1$$$)  — the elements of the permutation. If $$$p_i \neq -1$$$, it's given, else it's unknown. It's guaranteed that if for some $$$i \neq j$$$ holds $$$p_i \neq -1, p_j \neq -1$$$, then $$$p_i \neq p_j$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer  — the number of ways to set unknown values to obtain an anti-median permutation, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, both $$$[1, 2]$$$ and $$$[2, 1]$$$ are anti-median.In the second test case, permutations $$$[1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2]$$$ are anti-median. The remaining two permutations, $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$, are bad arrays on their own, as their median, $$$2$$$, is in their middle.In the third test case, $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ isn't anti-median, as it contains bad subarray $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$.In the fourth test case, the only anti-median array you can get is $$$[5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2]$$$.
