B. Friendly Arraystime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two arrays of integers — $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, and $$$b_1, \ldots, b_m$$$ of length $$$m$$$. You can choose any element $$$b_j$$$ from array $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \leq j \leq m$$$), and for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ perform $$$a_i = a_i | b_j$$$. You can perform any number of such operations.After all the operations, the value of $$$x = a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus a_n$$$ will be calculated. Find the minimum and maximum values of $$$x$$$ that could be obtained after performing any set of operations.Above, $$$|$$$ is the bitwise OR operation, and $$$\oplus$$$ is the bitwise XOR operation.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the sizes of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$0 \leq b_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the array $$$b$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of values of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$2$$$ numbers: the minimum and maximum possible values of $$$x$$$ after performing any set of operations.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, if we apply the operation with element $$$b_1 = 1$$$, the array $$$a$$$ will become $$$[1, 1]$$$, and $$$x$$$ will be $$$0$$$. If no operations are applied, then $$$x = 1$$$.In the second test case, if no operations are applied, then $$$x = 2$$$. If we apply the operation with $$$b_1 = 1$$$, then $$$a = [1, 1, 3]$$$, and $$$x = 3$$$.
