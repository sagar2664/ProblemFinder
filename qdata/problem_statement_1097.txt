NoteIn the first test case, it can be proved that the minimum number of characters that Chiyuu has to remove is $$$2$$$. There are $$$4$$$ ways to remove $$$2$$$ characters to make $$$s$$$ balanced as follows. Deleted characters are noted as red.  $$$\texttt{(} \color{Red}{\texttt{)}} \texttt{)} \color{Red}{\texttt{(}} \texttt{(} \texttt{)}$$$,  $$$\texttt{(} \texttt{)} \color{Red}{\texttt{)}} \color{Red}{\texttt{(}} \texttt{(} \texttt{)}$$$,  $$$\texttt{(} \color{Red}{\texttt{)}} \texttt{)} \texttt{(} \color{Red}{\texttt{(}} \texttt{)}$$$,  $$$\texttt{(} \texttt{)} \color{Red}{\texttt{)}} \texttt{(} \color{Red}{\texttt{(}} \texttt{)}$$$. In the second test case, the only way to make $$$s$$$ balanced is by deleting the only character to get an empty bracket sequence, which is considered balanced.
