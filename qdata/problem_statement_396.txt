C. Minimum Arraytime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of integers. Then the following operation is sequentially applied to it $$$q$$$ times: Choose indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) and an integer $$$x$$$; Add $$$x$$$ to all elements of the array $$$a$$$ in the segment $$$[l, r]$$$. More formally, assign $$$a_i := a_i + x$$$ for all $$$l \le i \le r$$$.Let $$$b_j$$$ be the array $$$a$$$ obtained after applying the first $$$j$$$ operations ($$$0 \le j \le q$$$). Note that $$$b_0$$$ is the array $$$a$$$ before applying any operations.You need to find the lexicographically minimum$$$^{\dagger}$$$ array among all arrays $$$b_j$$$.$$$^{\dagger}$$$An array $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than array $$$y$$$ if there is an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$x_i < y_i$$$, and $$$x_j = y_j$$$ for all $$$j < i$$$. In other words, for the first index $$$i$$$ where the arrays differ, $$$x_i < y_i$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.The third line of each test case contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$0 \le q \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of operations on the array.In each of the next $$$q$$$ lines, there are three integers $$$l_j$$$, $$$r_j$$$, and $$$x_j$$$ $$$(1 \le l_j \le r_j \le n, -10^9 \le x_j \le 10^9)$$$ — the description of each operation. The operations are given in the order they are applied.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the lexicographically minimum array among all arrays $$$b_j$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case: $$$b_0 = [1,2,3,4]$$$; $$$b_1 = [1,2,3,4]$$$; $$$b_2 = [-99,-98,-97,4]$$$.Thus, the lexicographically minimum array is $$$b_2$$$.In the second test case, the lexicographically minimum array is $$$b_0$$$.
