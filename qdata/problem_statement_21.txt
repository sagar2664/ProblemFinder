E. Clique Partitiontime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. There is a graph on $$$n$$$ vertices, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, which initially has no edges.You have to assign each vertex an integer; let $$$a_i$$$ be the integer on the vertex $$$i$$$. All $$$a_i$$$ should be distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices $$$(i, j)$$$, you add an edge between them if $$$|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k$$$.Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum possible (for the given values of $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$) number of cliques. Each vertex of the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques". So we also ask you to print the partition itself.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1600$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 40$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 2n$$$).OutputFor each test case, print three lines:  the first line should contain $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the values you assign to the vertices;  the second line should contain one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le n$$$) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into;  the third line should contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le q$$$) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ are in the same clique if $$$c_u = c_v$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExampleInput
