For example, the strings $$$\texttt{z}$$$, $$$\texttt{aaa}$$$, $$$\texttt{aba}$$$, and $$$\texttt{abccba}$$$ are palindromes, but $$$\texttt{codeforces}$$$ and $$$\texttt{ab}$$$ are not.The double of a string $$$s$$$ is obtained by writing each character twice. For example, the double of $$$\texttt{seeing}$$$ is $$$\texttt{sseeeeiinngg}$$$.Given a string $$$s$$$, rearrange its double to form a palindrome. Output the rearranged string. It can be proven that such a rearrangement always exists.InputThe first line of input contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 100$$$) consisting only of lowercase English letters.Note that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases is not bounded.OutputFor each test case, output a palindromic string of length $$$2 \cdot |s|$$$ that is a rearrangement of the double of $$$s$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the double of $$$\texttt{a}$$$ is $$$\texttt{aa}$$$, which is already a palindrome.In the second test case, the double of $$$\texttt{sururu}$$$ is $$$\texttt{ssuurruurruu}$$$. If we move the first $$$\texttt{s}$$$ to the end, we get $$$\texttt{suurruurruus}$$$, which is a palindrome.In the third test case, the double of $$$\texttt{errorgorn}$$$ is $$$\texttt{eerrrroorrggoorrnn}$$$. We can rearrange the characters to form $$$\texttt{rgnororerrerorongr}$$$, which is a palindrome.
