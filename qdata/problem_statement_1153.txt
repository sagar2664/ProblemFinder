A. Doremy's Painttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDoremy has $$$n$$$ buckets of paint which is represented by an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Bucket $$$i$$$ contains paint with color $$$a_i$$$. Let $$$c(l,r)$$$ be the number of distinct elements in the subarray $$$[a_l,a_{l+1},\ldots,a_r]$$$. Choose $$$2$$$ integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$l \leq r$$$ and $$$r-l-c(l,r)$$$ is maximized.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$l \leq r$$$ and $$$r-l-c(l,r)$$$ is maximized.If there are multiple solutions, you may output any.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$a=[1,3,2,2,4]$$$.  When $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=3$$$, $$$c(l,r)=3$$$ (there are $$$3$$$ distinct elements in $$$[1,3,2]$$$).  When $$$l=2$$$ and $$$r=4$$$, $$$c(l,r)=2$$$ (there are $$$2$$$ distinct elements in $$$[3,2,2]$$$). It can be shown that choosing $$$l=2$$$ and $$$r=4$$$ maximizes the value of $$$r-l-c(l,r)$$$ at $$$0$$$.For the second test case, $$$a=[1,2,3,4,5]$$$.   When $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=5$$$, $$$c(l,r)=5$$$ (there are $$$5$$$ distinct elements in $$$[1,2,3,4,5]$$$).  When $$$l=3$$$ and $$$r=3$$$, $$$c(l,r)=1$$$ (there is $$$1$$$ distinct element in $$$[3]$$$). It can be shown that choosing $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=5$$$ maximizes the value of $$$r-l-c(l,r)$$$ at $$$-1$$$. Choosing $$$l=3$$$ and $$$r=3$$$ is also acceptable.
