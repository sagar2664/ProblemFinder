Initially, $$$S = \{1,2,3, \ldots, n\}$$$.You will perform the following operation $$$n-1$$$ times.  Choose the largest number $$$S_{\text{max}}$$$ in $$$S$$$ and the smallest number $$$S_{\text{min}}$$$ in $$$S$$$. Remove the two numbers from $$$S$$$, and add $$$S_{\text{max}} - S_{\text{min}}$$$ into $$$S$$$. It's easy to show that there will be exactly one number left after $$$n-1$$$ operations. Output that number.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Their description follows.For each test case, one single line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^9$$$) — the initial size of the multiset $$$S$$$.OutputFor each test case, output an integer denoting the only number left after $$$n-1$$$ operations.ExampleInput

NoteWe show how the multiset $$$S$$$ changes for $$$n=4$$$. Operation $$$1$$$: $$$S=\{1,2,3,4\}$$$, remove $$$4$$$, $$$1$$$, add $$$3$$$. Operation $$$2$$$: $$$S=\{2,3,3\}$$$, remove $$$3$$$, $$$2$$$, add $$$1$$$. Operation $$$3$$$: $$$S=\{1,3\}$$$, remove $$$3$$$, $$$1$$$, add $$$2$$$. Final: $$$S = \{2\}$$$.Thus, the answer for $$$n = 4$$$ is $$$2$$$.
