C. Binary Strings are Funtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA binary string$$$^\dagger$$$ $$$b$$$ of odd length $$$m$$$ is good if $$$b_i$$$ is the median$$$^\ddagger$$$ of $$$b[1,i]^\S$$$ for all odd indices $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq m$$$).For a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$, a binary string $$$b$$$ of length $$$2k-1$$$ is an extension of $$$a$$$ if $$$b_{2i-1}=a_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \leq i \leq k$$$. For example, 1001011 and 1101001 are extensions of the string 1001. String $$$x=$$$1011011 is not an extension of string $$$y=$$$1001 because $$$x_3 \neq y_2$$$. Note that there are $$$2^{k-1}$$$ different extensions of $$$a$$$.You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Find the sum of the number of good extensions over all prefixes of $$$s$$$. In other words, find $$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(s[1,i])$$$, where $$$f(x)$$$ gives number of good extensions of string $$$x$$$. Since the answer can be quite large, you only need to find it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.$$$^\dagger$$$ A binary string is a string whose elements are either $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$\mathtt{1}$$$.$$$^\ddagger$$$ For a binary string $$$a$$$ of length $$$2m-1$$$, the median of $$$a$$$ is the (unique) element that occurs at least $$$m$$$ times in $$$a$$$.$$$^\S$$$ $$$a[l,r]$$$ denotes the string of length $$$r-l+1$$$ which is formed by the concatenation of $$$a_l,a_{l+1},\ldots,a_r$$$ in that order.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$), where $$$n$$$ is the length of the binary string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains the binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first and second test cases, $$$f(s[1,1])=1$$$.In the third test case, the answer is $$$f(s[1,1])+f(s[1,2])=1+2=3$$$. In the fourth test case, the answer is $$$f(s[1,1])+f(s[1,2])+f(s[1,3])=1+1+1=3$$$.$$$f(\mathtt{11})=2$$$ because two good extensions are possible: 101 and 111.$$$f(\mathtt{01})=1$$$ because only one good extension is possible: 011.
