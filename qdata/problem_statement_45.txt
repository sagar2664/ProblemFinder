D2. Counting Is Fun (Hard Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $$$n$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.An array $$$b$$$ of $$$m$$$ non-negative integers is said to be good if all the elements of $$$b$$$ can be made equal to $$$0$$$ using the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:   Select two distinct indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \color{red}{<} r \leq m$$$) and subtract $$$1$$$ from all $$$b_i$$$ such that $$$l \leq i \leq r$$$. You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and a prime number $$$p$$$.Over all $$$(k+1)^n$$$ arrays of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$0 \leq a_i \leq k$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, count the number of good arrays.Since the number might be too large, you are only required to find it modulo $$$p$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three positive integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$p$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 3000$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq n$$$, $$$10^8 < p < 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$, the upper bound on the elements of $$$a$$$ and modulus $$$p$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^7$$$, and $$$p$$$ is prime.OutputFor each test case, on a new line, output the number of good arrays modulo $$$p$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the $$$4$$$ good arrays $$$a$$$ are:   $$$[0,0,0]$$$;  $$$[0,1,1]$$$;  $$$[1,1,0]$$$;  $$$[1,1,1]$$$.
