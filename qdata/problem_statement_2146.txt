F1. Korney Korneevich and XOR (easy version)time limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an easier version of the problem with smaller constraints.Korney Korneevich dag up an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Korney Korneevich has recently read about the operation bitwise XOR, so he wished to experiment with it. For this purpose, he decided to find all integers $$$x \ge 0$$$ such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array $$$a$$$, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to $$$x$$$.It didn't take a long time for Korney Korneevich to find all such $$$x$$$, and he wants to check his result. That's why he asked you to solve this problem!A sequence $$$s$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$s$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.A sequence $$$s_1, s_2, \ldots , s_m$$$ is called increasing if $$$s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_m$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 500$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputIn the first line print a single integer $$$k$$$ — the number of found $$$x$$$ values.In the second line print $$$k$$$ integers in increasing order $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots x_k$$$ ($$$0 \le x_1 < \ldots < x_k$$$) — found $$$x$$$ values.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first test case:  To get value $$$x = 0$$$ it is possible to choose and empty subsequence  To get value $$$x = 2$$$ it is possible to choose a subsequence $$$[2]$$$  To get value $$$x = 4$$$ it is possible to choose a subsequence $$$[4]$$$  To get value $$$x = 6$$$ it is possible to choose a subsequence $$$[2, 4]$$$
