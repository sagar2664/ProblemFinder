B. Berland Musictime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBerland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module.So imagine Monocarp got recommended $$$n$$$ songs, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th song had its predicted rating equal to $$$p_i$$$, where $$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$ and every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. In other words, $$$p$$$ is a permutation.After listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string $$$s$$$, such that $$$s_i=0$$$ means that he disliked the $$$i$$$-th song, and $$$s_i=1$$$ means that he liked it.Now the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:  the new ratings $$$q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n$$$ still form a permutation ($$$1 \le q_i \le n$$$; each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once);  every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all $$$i, j$$$ such that $$$s_i=1$$$ and $$$s_j=0$$$, $$$q_i>q_j$$$ should hold). Among all valid permutations $$$q$$$ find the one that has the smallest value of $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|$$$, where $$$|x|$$$ is an absolute value of $$$x$$$.Print the permutation $$$q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n$$$. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of songs.The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$) — the permutation of the predicted ratings.The third line contains a single string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ characters. Each character is either a $$$0$$$ or a $$$1$$$. $$$0$$$ means that Monocarp disliked the song, and $$$1$$$ means that he liked it.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print a permutation $$$q$$$ — the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|$$$ is minimum possible, you can print any of them.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase, there exists only one permutation $$$q$$$ such that each liked song is rating higher than each disliked song: song $$$1$$$ gets rating $$$2$$$ and song $$$2$$$ gets rating $$$1$$$. $$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n |p_i-q_i|=|1-2|+|2-1|=2$$$.In the second testcase, Monocarp liked all songs, so all permutations could work. The permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the permutation equal to $$$p$$$. Its cost is $$$0$$$.
