D. Bitwise Paradoxtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$ along with a fixed integer $$$v$$$.An interval $$$[l, r]$$$ is called a good interval if $$$(b_l \mid b_{l+1} \mid \ldots \mid b_r) \ge v$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation. The beauty of a good interval is defined as $$$\max(a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r)$$$.You are given $$$q$$$ queries of two types:  "1 i x": assign $$$b_i := x$$$;  "2 l r": find the minimum beauty among all good intervals $$$[l_0,r_0]$$$ satisfying $$$l \le l_0 \le r_0 \le r$$$. If there is no suitable good interval, output $$$-1$$$ instead. Please process all queries.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le v \le 10^9$$$).The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).The third line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$).The fourth line of each testcase contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains the description of queries. Each line is of one of two types:  "1 i x" ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le x \le 10^9)$$$;  "2 l r" ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$). It is guaranteed that both the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the answers for all queries of the second type.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$a = [2, 1, 3]$$$, $$$b = [2, 2, 3]$$$, and $$$v = 7$$$.The first query is of the second type and has $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 3$$$. The largest interval available is $$$[1, 3]$$$, and its bitwise OR is $$$b_1 \mid b_2 \mid b_3 = 3$$$ which is less than $$$v$$$. Thus, no good interval exists.The second query asks to change $$$b_2$$$ to $$$5$$$, so $$$b$$$ becomes $$$[2, 5, 3]$$$.The third query is of the second type and has $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 3$$$. There are three possible intervals: $$$[2, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 3]$$$, and $$$[2, 3]$$$. However, $$$b_2 = 5 < v$$$, $$$b_3 = 3 < v$$$. So only the last interval is good: it has $$$b_2 \mid b_3 = 7$$$. The answer is thus $$$\max(a_2, a_3) = 3$$$.The fourth query is of the second type and has $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 3$$$. There are three good intervals: $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 3]$$$, and $$$[1, 3]$$$. Their beauty is $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$3$$$ correspondingly. The answer is thus $$$2$$$.In the second test case, $$$a = [5, 1, 2, 4]$$$, $$$b = [4, 2, 3, 3]$$$, and $$$v = 5$$$.The first query has $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 4$$$. The only good intervals are: $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[1, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 4]$$$. Their beauty is $$$5$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$5$$$ correspondingly. The answer is thus $$$5$$$.
