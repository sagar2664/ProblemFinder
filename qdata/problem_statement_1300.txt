A. Make A Equal to Btime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements, each element is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.You can make operations of $$$2$$$ kinds.   Pick an index $$$i$$$ and change $$$a_i$$$ to $$$1-a_i$$$.  Rearrange the array $$$a$$$ however you want. Find the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 400$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100$$$) — the length of the arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$a_i$$$ is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$), representing the array $$$a$$$.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$$$ ($$$b_i$$$ is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$), representing the array $$$b$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first case, we need only one operation: change $$$a_1$$$ to $$$1-a_i$$$. Now $$$a = [0, 0]$$$ which is equal to $$$b$$$.In the second case, the optimal way is to rearrange $$$a$$$ to get the array $$$[0, 1, 11$$$. Now $$$a = [0, 0, 1]$$$ which is equal to $$$b$$$.In the second case, one of optimal ways would be to first change $$$a_3$$$ to $$$1 - a_3$$$, then rearrange $$$a$$$.In the third case, no operation is needed.In the fourth case, the optimal way is to rearrange $$$a$$$ to get the array $$$[0, 1, 1, 0]$$$.
