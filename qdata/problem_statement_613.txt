B. Monsterstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp is playing yet another computer game. And yet again, his character is killing some monsters. There are $$$n$$$ monsters, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and the $$$i$$$-th of them has $$$a_i$$$ health points initially.Monocarp's character has an ability that deals $$$k$$$ damage to the monster with the highest current health. If there are several of them, the one with the smaller index is chosen. If a monster's health becomes less than or equal to $$$0$$$ after Monocarp uses his ability, then it dies.Monocarp uses his ability until all monsters die. Your task is to determine the order in which monsters will die.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 10^9$$$) — the number of monsters and the damage which Monocarp's ability deals.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the initial health points of monsters.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers — the indices of monsters in the order they die.

NoteIn the first example, the health points change as follows: $$$[1, 2, \underline{3}] \rightarrow [1, \underline{2}, 1] \rightarrow [\underline{1}, 0, 1] \rightarrow [-1, 0, \underline{1}] \rightarrow [-1, 0, -1]$$$. The monster that is going to take damage the next time Monocarp uses his ability is underlined.In the second example, the health points change as follows: $$$[\underline{1}, 1] \rightarrow [-2, \underline{1}] \rightarrow [-2, -2]$$$.In the third example, the health points change as follows: $$$[2, \underline{8}, 3, 5] \rightarrow [2, \underline{5}, 3, 5] \rightarrow [2, 2, 3, \underline{5}] \rightarrow [2, 2, \underline{3}, 2] \rightarrow [\underline{2}, 2, 0, 2] \rightarrow [-1, \underline{2}, 0, 2] \rightarrow [-1, -1, 0, \underline{2}] \rightarrow [-1, -1, 0, -1]$$$.
