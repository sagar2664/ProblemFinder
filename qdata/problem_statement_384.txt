B. Qingshan Loves Stringstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputQingshan has a string $$$s$$$, while Daniel has a string $$$t$$$. Both strings only contain $$$\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\texttt{1}$$$.A string $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ is good if and only if  $$$a_i \ne a_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$i=1,2,\ldots,k-1$$$. For example, $$$\texttt{1}$$$, $$$\texttt{101}$$$, $$$\texttt{0101}$$$ are good, while $$$\texttt{11}$$$, $$$\texttt{1001}$$$, $$$\texttt{001100}$$$ are not good.Qingshan wants to make $$$s$$$ good. To do this, she can do the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero):  insert $$$t$$$ to any position of $$$s$$$ (getting a new $$$s$$$). Please tell Qingshan if it is possible to make $$$s$$$ good.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1\le T\le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n,m \le 50$$$) — the length of the strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, respectively.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.The third line of each test case contains a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$.It is guaranteed that $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ only contain $$$\texttt{0}$$$ and $$$\texttt{1}$$$.OutputFor each test case, print "YES" (without quotes), if it is possible to make $$$s$$$ good, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$s$$$ is good initially, so you can get a good $$$s$$$ by doing zero operations.In the second test case, you can do the following two operations (the inserted string $$$t$$$ is underlined):  $$$\texttt{1}\underline{\texttt{010}}\texttt{11}$$$  $$$\texttt{10101}\underline{\texttt{010}}\texttt{1}$$$ and get $$$s = \texttt{101010101}$$$, which is good.In the third test case, there is no way to make $$$s$$$ good after any number of operations.
