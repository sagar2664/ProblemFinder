E. Matrix Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a matrix $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ rows by $$$m$$$ columns. Each element of the matrix is equal to $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose an element of the matrix and replace it with either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.You are also given two arrays $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ (of length $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ respectively). After you perform the operations, the matrix should satisfy the following conditions:  the number of ones in the $$$i$$$-th row of the matrix should be exactly $$$A_i$$$ for every $$$i \in [1, n]$$$.  the number of ones in the $$$j$$$-th column of the matrix should be exactly $$$B_j$$$ for every $$$j \in [1, m]$$$. Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n, m \le 50$$$).Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \dots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$0 \le a_{i,j} \le 1$$$).The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$$$ ($$$0\le A_i\le m$$$).The next line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m$$$ ($$$0\le B_i\le n$$$).OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of operations you have to perform, or -1 if it is impossible.ExamplesInput
