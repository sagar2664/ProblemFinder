Find the maximum cost across all cyclic shifts of $$$p$$$.$$$^\dagger\operatorname{mex}([b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m])$$$ is the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$x$$$ does not occur among $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m$$$.$$$^\ddagger$$$A permutation of the set $$$\{0,1,2,...,n-1\}$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[1,2,0,4,3]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[0,1,1]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$1$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[0,2,3]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$3$$$ in the array).InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.The second line of each test case contain $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$0 \le p_i < n$$$) — the elements of the permutation $$$p$$$.It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum cost across all cyclic shifts of $$$p$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the cyclic shift that yields the maximum cost is $$$[2,1,0,5,4,3]$$$ with cost $$$0+0+3+3+3+6=15$$$.In the second test case, the cyclic shift that yields the maximum cost is $$$[0,2,1]$$$ with cost $$$1+1+3=5$$$.
