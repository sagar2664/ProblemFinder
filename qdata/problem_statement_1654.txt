Moreover, the first letter of a word is different from the second letter. Any combination of two different Berland letters (which, by the way, are the same as the lowercase letters of Latin alphabet) is a correct word in Berland language.The Berland dictionary contains all words of this language. The words are listed in a way they are usually ordered in dictionaries. Formally, word $$$a$$$ comes earlier than word $$$b$$$ in the dictionary if one of the following conditions hold:  the first letter of $$$a$$$ is less than the first letter of $$$b$$$;  the first letters of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are the same, and the second letter of $$$a$$$ is less than the second letter of $$$b$$$. So, the dictionary looks like that:  Word $$$1$$$: ab  Word $$$2$$$: ac  ...  Word $$$25$$$: az  Word $$$26$$$: ba  Word $$$27$$$: bc  ...  Word $$$649$$$: zx  Word $$$650$$$: zy You are given a word $$$s$$$ from the Berland language. Your task is to find its index in the dictionary.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 650$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing $$$s$$$ — a string consisting of exactly two different lowercase Latin letters (i. e. a correct word of the Berland language).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the index of the word $$$s$$$ in the dictionary.ExampleInput
