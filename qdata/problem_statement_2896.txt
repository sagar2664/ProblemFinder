B. Graph Subset Problemtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. Also, you are given an integer $$$k$$$.Find either a clique of size $$$k$$$ or a non-empty subset of vertices such that each vertex of this subset has at least $$$k$$$ neighbors in the subset. If there are no such cliques and subsets report about it.A subset of vertices is called a clique of size $$$k$$$ if its size is $$$k$$$ and there exists an edge between every two vertices from the subset. A vertex is called a neighbor of the other vertex if there exists an edge between them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of test cases.The first line of the description of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, m, k \leq 10^5$$$, $$$k \leq n$$$).Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u, v$$$ $$$(1 \leq u, v \leq n, u \neq v)$$$, denoting an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases and the sum of $$$m$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case: If you found a subset of vertices such that each vertex of this subset has at least $$$k$$$ neighbors in the subset in the first line output $$$1$$$ and the size of the subset. On the second line output the vertices of the subset in any order.If you found a clique of size $$$k$$$ then in the first line output $$$2$$$ and in the second line output the vertices of the clique in any order.If there are no required subsets and cliques print $$$-1$$$.If there exists multiple possible answers you can print any of them.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case: the subset $$$\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$$$ is a clique of size $$$4$$$.In the second test case: degree of each vertex in the original graph is at least $$$3$$$. So the set of all vertices is a correct answer.In the third test case: there are no cliques of size $$$4$$$ or required subsets, so the answer is $$$-1$$$.
