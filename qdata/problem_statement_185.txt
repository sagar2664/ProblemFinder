G. Mischievous Shootertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOnce the mischievous and wayward shooter named Shel found himself on a rectangular field of size $$$n \times m$$$, divided into unit squares. Each cell either contains a target or not.Shel only had a lucky shotgun with him, with which he can shoot in one of the four directions: right-down, left-down, left-up, or right-up. When fired, the shotgun hits all targets in the chosen direction, the Manhattan distance to which does not exceed a fixed constant $$$k$$$. The Manhattan distance between two points $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ is equal to $$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$$$.  Possible hit areas for $$$k = 3$$$. Shel's goal is to hit as many targets as possible. Please help him find this value.InputEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains field dimensions $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and the constant for the shotgun's power $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m, k \le 10^5, 1 \le n \cdot m \le 10^5$$$).Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ characters — the description of the next field row, where the character '.' means the cell is empty, and the character '#' indicates the presence of a target. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer on a separate line, which is equal to the maximum possible number of hit targets with one shot.ExampleInput
