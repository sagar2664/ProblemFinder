Can he do it?InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$) — the number of puzzle pieces.OutputFor each test case, if Phoenix can create a square with the $$$n$$$ puzzle pieces, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.ExampleInput
