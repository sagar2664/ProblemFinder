Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, find some positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that   $$$s(a) \ge n$$$,  $$$s(b) \ge n$$$,  $$$s(a + b) \le m$$$. InputThe only line of input contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 1129$$$).OutputPrint two lines, one for decimal representation of $$$a$$$ and one for decimal representation of $$$b$$$. Both numbers must not contain leading zeros and must have length no more than $$$2230$$$.ExamplesInput6 5Output6 7Input8 16Output35 53NoteIn the first sample, we have $$$n = 6$$$ and $$$m = 5$$$. One valid solution is $$$a = 6$$$, $$$b = 7$$$. Indeed, we have $$$s(a) = 6 \ge n$$$ and $$$s(b) = 7 \ge n$$$, and also $$$s(a + b) = s(13) = 4 \le m$$$.
