A. Binary Decimaltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a number a binary decimal if it's a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. For example, $$$1\,010\,111$$$ is a binary decimal, while $$$10\,201$$$ and $$$787\,788$$$ are not.Given a number $$$n$$$, you are asked to represent $$$n$$$ as a sum of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals. Compute the smallest number of binary decimals required for that.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$), denoting the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$), denoting the number to be represented.OutputFor each test case, output the smallest number of binary decimals required to represent $$$n$$$ as a sum.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$121$$$ can be represented as $$$121 = 110 + 11$$$ or $$$121 = 111 + 10$$$.In the second test case, $$$5$$$ can be represented as $$$5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$$$.In the third test case, $$$1\,000\,000\,000$$$ is a binary decimal itself, thus the answer is $$$1$$$.
