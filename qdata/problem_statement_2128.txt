A. Life of a Flowertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPetya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given $$$n$$$ days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.The flower grows as follows:   If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies.  If the flower is watered in the $$$i$$$-th day, it grows by $$$1$$$ centimeter.  If the flower is watered in the $$$i$$$-th and in the $$$(i-1)$$$-th day ($$$i > 1$$$), then it grows by $$$5$$$ centimeters instead of $$$1$$$.  If the flower is not watered in the $$$i$$$-th day, it does not grow. At the beginning of the $$$1$$$-st day the flower is $$$1$$$ centimeter tall. What is its height after $$$n$$$ days?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains the only integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i = 0$$$ or $$$a_i = 1$$$). If $$$a_i = 1$$$, the flower is watered in the $$$i$$$-th day, otherwise it is not watered.OutputFor each test case print a single integer $$$k$$$ — the flower's height after $$$n$$$ days, or $$$-1$$$, if the flower dies.ExampleInput
