A. GCD Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe $$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}$$$ of a positive integer is the $$$gcd$$$ of that integer with its sum of digits. Formally, $$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(x) = gcd(x, \text{ sum of digits of } x)$$$ for a positive integer $$$x$$$. $$$gcd(a, b)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ — the largest integer $$$d$$$ such that both integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are divisible by $$$d$$$.For example: $$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(762) = gcd(762, 7 + 6 + 2)=gcd(762,15) = 3$$$.Given an integer $$$n$$$, find the smallest integer $$$x \ge n$$$ such that $$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(x) > 1$$$.InputThe first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ lines follow, each containing a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 10^{18})$$$.All test cases in one test are different.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th line is a single integer containing the answer to the $$$i$$$-th test case.ExampleInput

NoteLet us explain the three test cases in the sample.Test case 1: $$$n = 11$$$: $$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(11) = gcd(11, 1 + 1) = gcd(11,\ 2) = 1$$$.$$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(12) = gcd(12, 1 + 2) = gcd(12,\ 3) = 3$$$.So the smallest number $$$\ge 11$$$ whose $$$gcdSum$$$ $$$> 1$$$ is $$$12$$$.Test case 2: $$$n = 31$$$: $$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(31) = gcd(31, 3 + 1) = gcd(31,\ 4) = 1$$$.$$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(32) = gcd(32, 3 + 2) = gcd(32,\ 5) = 1$$$.$$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(33) = gcd(33, 3 + 3) = gcd(33,\ 6) = 3$$$.So the smallest number $$$\ge 31$$$ whose $$$gcdSum$$$ $$$> 1$$$ is $$$33$$$.Test case 3: $$$\ n = 75$$$: $$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}(75) = gcd(75, 7 + 5) = gcd(75,\ 12) = 3$$$.The $$$\text{$$$gcdSum$$$}$$$ of $$$75$$$ is already $$$> 1$$$. Hence, it is the answer.
