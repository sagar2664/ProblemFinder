He's going to kill $$$n$$$ monsters, the $$$i$$$-th of them has $$$h_i$$$ health.Monocarp's character has two spells, either of which he can cast an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) and in an arbitrary order:   choose exactly two alive monsters and decrease their health by $$$1$$$;  choose a single monster and kill it. When a monster's health becomes $$$0$$$, it dies.What's the minimum number of spell casts Monocarp should perform in order to kill all monsters?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of monsters.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \le h_i \le 100$$$) — the health of each monster.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^4$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print a single integer — the minimum number of spell casts Monocarp should perform in order to kill all monsters.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase, the initial health list is $$$[1, 2, 1, 2]$$$. Three spells are casted:   the first spell on monsters $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ — monster $$$1$$$ dies, monster $$$2$$$ has now health $$$1$$$, new health list is $$$[0, 1, 1, 2]$$$;  the first spell on monsters $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ — monster $$$3$$$ dies, monster $$$4$$$ has now health $$$1$$$, new health list is $$$[0, 1, 0, 1]$$$;  the first spell on monsters $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ — both monsters $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ die. In the second testcase, the initial health list is $$$[2, 4, 2]$$$. Three spells are casted:   the first spell on monsters $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ — both monsters have health $$$1$$$ now, new health list is $$$[1, 4, 1]$$$;  the second spell on monster $$$2$$$ — monster $$$2$$$ dies, new health list is $$$[1, 0, 1]$$$;  the first spell on monsters $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ — both monsters $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ die. In the third testcase, the initial health list is $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$$$. Five spells are casted. The $$$i$$$-th of them kills the $$$i$$$-th monster with the second spell.
