C. Phase Shifttime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere was a string $$$s$$$ which was supposed to be encrypted. For this reason, all $$$26$$$ lowercase English letters were arranged in a circle in some order, afterwards, each letter in $$$s$$$ was replaced with the one that follows in clockwise order, in that way the string $$$t$$$ was obtained. You are given a string $$$t$$$. Determine the lexicographically smallest string $$$s$$$ that could be a prototype of the given string $$$t$$$.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ of the same length if and only if:   in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter, that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.  InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$t$$$.The next line contains the string $$$t$$$ of the length $$$n$$$, containing lowercase English letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing the lexicographically smallest string $$$s$$$ which could be a prototype of $$$t$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, we couldn't have the string "a", since the letter a would transit to itself. Lexicographically the second string "b" is suitable as an answer.In the second test case, the string "aa" is not suitable, since a would transit to itself. "ab" is not suitable, since the circle would be closed with $$$2$$$ letters, but it must contain all $$$26$$$. The next string "ac" is suitable.Below you can see the schemes for the first three test cases. The non-involved letters are skipped, they can be arbitrary placed in the gaps.
