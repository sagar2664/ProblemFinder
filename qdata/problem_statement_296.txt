H. Twin Friendstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou meet two new friends who are twins. The name of the elder twin is $$$A$$$, which consists of $$$N$$$ characters. While the name of the younger twin is $$$B$$$, which consists of $$$M$$$ characters. It is known that $$$N \leq M$$$.You want to call each of them with a nickname. For the elder twin, you want to pick any permutation of $$$A$$$ as the nickname. For the younger twin, you want to remove exactly $$$M - N$$$ characters from any permutation of $$$B$$$. Denote the nicknames of the elder twin and the younger twin as $$$A'$$$ and $$$B'$$$, respectively.You want the nicknames to satisfy the following requirement. For each $$$i$$$ that satisfies $$$1 \leq i \leq N$$$, $$$B'_i$$$ must be equal to either $$$A'_i$$$ or the next letter that follows alphabetically after $$$A'_i$$$ (if such a next letter exists).Determine the number of different pairs of nicknames $$$(A', B')$$$ that satisfy the requirement. Two pairs of nicknames are considered different if at least one of the nicknames are different. As the result might be large, find the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.InputThe first line consists of two integers $$$N$$$ $$$M$$$ ($$$1 \leq N \leq M \leq 200\,000$$$).The second line consists of a string $$$A$$$ of length $$$N$$$.The third line consists of a string $$$B$$$ of length $$$M$$$.All strings consist of only upper-case letters.OutputOutput a single integer representing number of different pairs $$$(A', B')$$$ that satisfy the requirement, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExamplesInput

NoteExplanation for the sample input/output #1The $$$9$$$ pairs are:  (AAM, AAN),  (AAM, ABN),  (AAM, BAN),  (AMA, ANA),  (AMA, ANB),  (AMA, BNA),  (MAA, NAA),  (MAA, NAB), and  (MAA, NBA). Explanation for the sample input/output #2The $$$120$$$ pairs are the pairs where $$$A'$$$ is a permutation of BINUS and $$$B' = A'$$$.
