He will perform $$$q$$$ operations of two types on the given strings:  $$$1 \;\; k \;\; x$$$ — Append the string $$$x$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times at the end of string $$$s$$$. In other words, $$$s := s + \underbrace{x + \dots + x}_{k \text{ times}}$$$.  $$$2 \;\; k \;\; x$$$ — Append the string $$$x$$$ exactly $$$k$$$ times at the end of string $$$t$$$. In other words, $$$t := t + \underbrace{x + \dots + x}_{k \text{ times}}$$$. After each operation, determine if it is possible to rearrange the characters of $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ such that $$$s$$$ is lexicographically smaller$$$^{\dagger}$$$ than $$$t$$$.Note that the strings change after performing each operation and don't go back to their initial states.$$$^{\dagger}$$$ Simply speaking, the lexicographical order is the order in which words are listed in a dictionary. A formal definition is as follows: string $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than string $$$q$$$ if there exists a position $$$i$$$ such that $$$p_i < q_i$$$, and for all $$$j < i$$$, $$$p_j = q_j$$$. If no such $$$i$$$ exists, then $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$ if the length of $$$p$$$ is less than the length of $$$q$$$. For example, $$$\texttt{abdc} < \texttt{abe}$$$ and $$$\texttt{abc} < \texttt{abcd}$$$, where we write $$$p < q$$$ if $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$q$$$ $$$(1 \leq q \leq 10^5)$$$ — the number of operations Alperen will perform.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each containing two positive integers $$$d$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq d \leq 2$$$; $$$1 \leq k \leq 10^5$$$) and a non-empty string $$$x$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters — the type of the operation, the number of times we will append string $$$x$$$ and the string we need to append respectively.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$ and that the sum of lengths of all strings $$$x$$$ in the input doesn't exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each operation, output "YES", if it is possible to arrange the elements in both strings in such a way that $$$s$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$t$$$ and "NO" otherwise.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the strings are initially $$$s = $$$ "a" and $$$t = $$$ "a". After the first operation the string $$$t$$$ becomes "aaa". Since "a" is already lexicographically smaller than "aaa", the answer for this operation should be "YES".After the second operation string $$$s$$$ becomes "aaa", and since $$$t$$$ is also equal to "aaa", we can't arrange $$$s$$$ in any way such that it is lexicographically smaller than $$$t$$$, so the answer is "NO".After the third operation string $$$t$$$ becomes "aaaaaa" and $$$s$$$ is already lexicographically smaller than it so the answer is "YES".After the fourth operation $$$s$$$ becomes "aaabb" and there is no way to make it lexicographically smaller than "aaaaaa" so the answer is "NO".After the fifth operation the string $$$t$$$ becomes "aaaaaaabcaabcaabca", and we can rearrange the strings to: "bbaaa" and "caaaaaabcaabcaabaa" so that $$$s$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$t$$$, so we should answer "YES".
