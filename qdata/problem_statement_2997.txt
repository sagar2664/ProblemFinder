D. Hexagonstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLindsey Buckingham told Stevie Nicks "Go your own way". Nicks is now sad and wants to go away as quickly as possible, but she lives in a 2D hexagonal world.Consider a hexagonal tiling of the plane as on the picture below.  Nicks wishes to go from the cell marked $$$(0, 0)$$$ to a certain cell given by the coordinates. She may go from a hexagon to any of its six neighbors you want, but there is a cost associated with each of them. The costs depend only on the direction in which you travel. Going from $$$(0, 0)$$$ to $$$(1, 1)$$$ will take the exact same cost as going from $$$(-2, -1)$$$ to $$$(-1, 0)$$$. The costs are given in the input in the order $$$c_1$$$, $$$c_2$$$, $$$c_3$$$, $$$c_4$$$, $$$c_5$$$, $$$c_6$$$ as in the picture below.  Print the smallest cost of a path from the origin which has coordinates $$$(0, 0)$$$ to the given cell.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^{4}$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \le x, y \le 10^{9}$$$) representing the coordinates of the target hexagon.The second line of each test case contains six integers $$$c_1$$$, $$$c_2$$$, $$$c_3$$$, $$$c_4$$$, $$$c_5$$$, $$$c_6$$$ ($$$1 \le c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6 \le 10^{9}$$$) representing the six costs of the making one step in a particular direction (refer to the picture above to see which edge is for each value).OutputFor each testcase output the smallest cost of a path from the origin to the given cell.ExampleInput

NoteThe picture below shows the solution for the first sample. The cost $$$18$$$ is reached by taking $$$c_3$$$ 3 times and $$$c_2$$$ once, amounting to $$$5+5+5+3=18$$$.
