For some unknown reason, you decided to calculate the following characteristic of the sequence:   Let $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) be the smallest $$$j \ge i$$$ such that on the subsegment $$$a_i, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_j$$$ all distinct numbers from the sequence $$$a$$$ appear. More formally, for any $$$k \in [1, n]$$$, there exists $$$l \in [i, j]$$$ such that $$$a_k = a_l$$$. If such $$$j$$$ does not exist, $$$r_i$$$ is considered to be equal to $$$n+1$$$.  The characteristic of the sequence $$$a$$$ is defined as the sequence $$$r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n$$$.  Unfortunately, the sequence $$$a$$$ got lost, but you still have its characteristic $$$r$$$. You want to reconstruct any sequence $$$a$$$ that matches the characteristic, or determine that there is an error in the characteristic and such a sequence does not exist.InputEach test consist of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the lost sequence $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n$$$ ($$$i \le r_i \le n+1$$$) — the characteristic of the lost sequence $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the following:   If there is no sequence $$$a$$$ with the characteristic $$$r$$$, print "No".  Otherwise, print "Yes" on the first line, and on the second line, print any sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) that matches the characteristic $$$r$$$.  You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the sequence $$$a = [1, 2, 1]$$$ is suitable. The integers $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ appear on the subsegments $$$[1, 2]$$$ and $$$[2, 3]$$$.In the second test case, it can be proved that there is no suitable sequence $$$a$$$.
