NoteIn the first example, we have the bookshelf $$$[1, 2, 2, 1, 3]$$$ and can, for example:   take a book on position $$$4$$$ and move to the right end: we'll get $$$[1, 2, 2, 3, 1]$$$;  take a book on position $$$1$$$ and move to the right end: we'll get $$$[2, 2, 3, 1, 1]$$$. In the second example, we can move the first book to the end of the bookshelf and get $$$[2,2,1,1,1]$$$.
