F. Nobody is neededtime limit per test6 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOleg received a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ as a birthday present.Oleg's friend Nechipor asks Oleg $$$q$$$ questions, each question is characterized by two numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, in response to the question Oleg must say the number of sets of indices $$$(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k)$$$ of any length $$$k \ge 1$$$ such that:   $$$l \le t_i \le r$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$.  $$$t_i < t_{i+1}$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k-1$$$.  $$$a_{t_{i+1}}$$$ is divisible by $$$a_{t_i}$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k-1$$$. Help Oleg and answer all of Nechipor's questions.InputEach test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of sets of input data. The description of the sets of input data follows.The first line of each set of input data contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 10^6$$$) — the length of the permutation and the number of Nechipor's questions.The second line of each set of input data contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the permutation $$$a$$$ itself.In each of the next $$$q$$$ lines of each set of input data, there are two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) — the next question of Nechipor.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ and the sum of the values of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each set of input data, output the answers to all of Nechipor's questions.ExampleInput
