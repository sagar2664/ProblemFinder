C. Palindrome Basistime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Let's call some positive integer $$$a$$$ without leading zeroes palindromic if it remains the same after reversing the order of its digits. Find the number of distinct ways to express $$$n$$$ as a sum of positive palindromic integers. Two ways are considered different if the frequency of at least one palindromic integer is different in them. For example, $$$5=4+1$$$ and $$$5=3+1+1$$$ are considered different but $$$5=3+1+1$$$ and $$$5=1+3+1$$$ are considered the same. Formally, you need to find the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers the sum of which is equal to $$$n$$$.Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\leq t\leq 10^4$$$) denoting the number of testcases.Each testcase contains a single line of input containing a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\leq n\leq 4\cdot 10^4$$$) — the required sum of palindromic integers.OutputFor each testcase, print a single integer denoting the required answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.ExampleInput

NoteFor the first testcase, there are $$$7$$$ ways to partition $$$5$$$ as a sum of positive palindromic integers:   $$$5=1+1+1+1+1$$$  $$$5=1+1+1+2$$$  $$$5=1+2+2$$$  $$$5=1+1+3$$$  $$$5=2+3$$$  $$$5=1+4$$$  $$$5=5$$$ For the second testcase, there are total $$$77$$$ ways to partition $$$12$$$ as a sum of positive integers but among them, the partitions $$$12=2+10$$$, $$$12=1+1+10$$$ and $$$12=12$$$ are not valid partitions of $$$12$$$ as a sum of positive palindromic integers because $$$10$$$ and $$$12$$$ are not palindromic. So, there are $$$74$$$ ways to partition $$$12$$$ as a sum of positive palindromic integers.
