C3. "Is the number of ones divisible by 3?" oracletime limit per test7 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputImplement a quantum oracle on $$$N$$$ qubits which checks whether the number of bits equal to 1 in the input vector $$$\vec{x}$$$ is divisible by 3 (i.e., implements the function $$$f(\vec{x}) = 1$$$ if the number of $$$x_i = 1$$$ in $$$\vec{x}$$$ is divisible by 3, and 0 otherwise).You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs: an array of $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \le N \le 9$$$) qubits $$$x$$$ in an arbitrary state (input register), a qubit $$$y$$$ in an arbitrary state (output qubit),and performs a transformation $$$|x\rangle|y\rangle \rightarrow |x\rangle|y \oplus f(x)\rangle$$$. The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits. Note that the input register $$$x$$$ has to remain unchanged after applying the operation.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : Unit {        body (...) {            // your code here        }        adjoint auto;    }}Note: the operation has to have an adjoint specified for it; adjoint auto means that the adjoint will be generated automatically. For details on adjoint, see Operation Declarations.You are not allowed to use measurements in your operation.
