B. Balanced Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer $$$n$$$, it is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is even (i.e. divisible by $$$2$$$).You want to construct the array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that:   The first $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ elements of $$$a$$$ are even (divisible by $$$2$$$);  the second $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ elements of $$$a$$$ are odd (not divisible by $$$2$$$);  all elements of $$$a$$$ are distinct and positive;  the sum of the first half equals to the sum of the second half ($$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{2}} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=\frac{n}{2} + 1}^{n} a_i$$$). If there are multiple answers, you can print any. It is not guaranteed that the answer exists.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The only line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. It is guaranteed that that $$$n$$$ is even (i.e. divisible by $$$2$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — "NO" (without quotes), if there is no suitable answer for the given test case or "YES" in the first line and any suitable array $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) satisfying conditions from the problem statement on the second line.ExampleInput
