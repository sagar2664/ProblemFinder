InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n , q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$), the length of $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.Next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_{i} \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of $$$a$$$.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines describes a query. It has one of the following forms.  $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$x$$$, ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$ , $$$1 \le x \le 10^9$$$), or  $$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ $$$k$$$, ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$ , $$$1 \le k \le n$$$). OutputFor each query of the second type, if answer of the query is yes, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".ExampleInput10 81234 2 3 3 2 1 1 2 3 42 1 6 21 1 12 1 6 22 1 9 21 10 52 1 9 31 3 52 3 10 2OutputNOYESNOYESYESNoteIn the first query, requested subarray is $$$[1234, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]$$$, and it's obvious that the number of occurrence of $$$1$$$ isn't divisible by $$$k = 2$$$. So the answer is "NO".In the third query, requested subarray is $$$[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]$$$, and it can be seen that the number of occurrence of every integer in this sub array is divisible by $$$k = 2$$$. So the answer is "YES".In the sixth query, requested subarray is $$$[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3]$$$, and it can be seen that the number of occurrence of every integer in this sub array is divisible by $$$k = 3$$$. So the answer is "YES".
