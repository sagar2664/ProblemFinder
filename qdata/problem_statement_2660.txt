F. Dogecointime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecently, cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular. Ann decided that it was about time she started mining the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Ann's computer is not very powerful, so Ann mines exactly $$$1$$$ Dogecoin per day. On the Internet, there are forecasts of the cost of $$$1$$$ dogecoin for the next $$$n$$$ days. Every day, Ann can sell any amount of dogecoin that she currently has. Note that if Ann mined Dogecoin on the $$$i$$$-th day, then she can sell it on the same day.Ann has not yet decided when to start mining. She has prepared $$$q$$$ possible plans and for each of them wants to know the maximum profit that she can get. Each of the plans is described by two numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ — the first and last days of mining. Note that Ann should not have any Dogecoin left after the $$$r$$$-th day.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$c_i$$$ is the cost of Dogecoin on the $$$i$$$-th day.The third line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of Ann's plans.The following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) — the first and last days of mining. OutputFor each Ann's plan print one integer — the maximum profit that she can get using this plan.ExampleInput
