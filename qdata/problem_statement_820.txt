6NoteIn the first test, the sequence created with $$$n = 5$$$ looks like $$$5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, \dots$$$, and none of the first $$$k=1$$$ terms are equal to $$$1$$$.In the second test, the sequence created with $$$n = 6$$$ looks like $$$6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, \dots$$$, and none of the first $$$k=5$$$ terms are equal to $$$1$$$.
