G. Maximum Adjacent Pairstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers.You have to replace each $$$0$$$ in $$$a$$$ with an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (different elements equal to $$$0$$$ can be replaced by different integers).The value of the array you obtain is the number of integers $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that the following condition holds: there exist a pair of adjacent elements equal to $$$k$$$ (i. e. there exists some $$$i \in [1, n - 1]$$$ such that $$$a_i = a_{i + 1} = k$$$). If there are multiple such pairs for some integer $$$k$$$, this integer is counted in the value only once.Your task is to obtain the array with the maximum possible value.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le \min(n, 600)$$$) — the elements of the array.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers not less than $$$1$$$ and not greater than $$$n$$$ — the array with the maximum possible value you can obtain.If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput
