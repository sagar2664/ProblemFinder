B. Deadly Lasertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe robot is placed in the top left corner of a grid, consisting of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, in a cell $$$(1, 1)$$$.In one step, it can move into a cell, adjacent by a side to the current one:   $$$(x, y) \rightarrow (x, y + 1)$$$;  $$$(x, y) \rightarrow (x + 1, y)$$$;  $$$(x, y) \rightarrow (x, y - 1)$$$;  $$$(x, y) \rightarrow (x - 1, y)$$$. The robot can't move outside the grid.The cell $$$(s_x, s_y)$$$ contains a deadly laser. If the robot comes into some cell that has distance less than or equal to $$$d$$$ to the laser, it gets evaporated. The distance between two cells $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ is $$$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$$$.Print the smallest number of steps that the robot can take to reach the cell $$$(n, m)$$$ without getting evaporated or moving outside the grid. If it's not possible to reach the cell $$$(n, m)$$$, print -1.The laser is neither in the starting cell, nor in the ending cell. The starting cell always has distance greater than $$$d$$$ to the laser.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The only line of each testcase contains five integers $$$n, m, s_x, s_y, d$$$ ($$$2 \le n, m \le 1000$$$; $$$1 \le s_x \le n$$$; $$$1 \le s_y \le m$$$; $$$0 \le d \le n + m$$$) — the size of the grid, the cell that contains the laser and the evaporating distance of the laser.The laser is neither in the starting cell, nor in the ending cell ($$$(s_x, s_y) \neq (1, 1)$$$ and $$$(s_x, s_y) \neq (n, m)$$$). The starting cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ always has distance greater than $$$d$$$ to the laser ($$$|s_x - 1| + |s_y - 1| > d$$$).OutputFor each testcase, print a single integer. If it's possible to reach the cell $$$(n, m)$$$ from $$$(1, 1)$$$ without getting evaporated or moving outside the grid, then print the smallest amount of steps it can take the robot to reach it. Otherwise, print -1.ExampleInput
