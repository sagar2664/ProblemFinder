C. Make it Alternatingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a binary string $$$s$$$. A binary string is a string consisting of characters 0 and/or 1.You can perform the following operation on $$$s$$$ any number of times (even zero):  choose an integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le |s|$$$, then erase the character $$$s_i$$$. You have to make $$$s$$$ alternating, i. e. after you perform the operations, every two adjacent characters in $$$s$$$ should be different.Your goal is to calculate two values:  the minimum number of operations required to make $$$s$$$ alternating;  the number of different shortest sequences of operations that make $$$s$$$ alternating. Two sequences of operations are different if in at least one operation, the chosen integer $$$i$$$ is different in these two sequences. InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$). The string $$$s$$$ consists of characters 0 and/or 1 only.Additional constraint on the input:  the total length of strings $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. OutputFor each test case, print two integers: the minimum number of operations you have to perform, and the number of different shortest sequences of operations. Since the second number might be large, print its remainder modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case of the example, the shortest sequences of operations are:  $$$[2]$$$ (delete the $$$2$$$-nd character);  $$$[3]$$$ (delete the $$$3$$$-rd character). In the second test case of the example, the shortest sequences of operations are:   $$$[2, 1]$$$ (delete the $$$2$$$-nd character, then delete the $$$1$$$-st character);  $$$[2, 2]$$$;  $$$[1, 1]$$$;  $$$[1, 2]$$$;  $$$[3, 1]$$$;  $$$[3, 2]$$$. In the third test case of the example, the only shortest sequence of operations is $$$[]$$$ (empty sequence).
