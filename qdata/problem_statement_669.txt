C. Ranom Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNo, not "random" numbers.Ranom digits are denoted by uppercase Latin letters from A to E. Moreover, the value of the letter A is $$$1$$$, B is $$$10$$$, C is $$$100$$$, D is $$$1000$$$, E is $$$10000$$$.A Ranom number is a sequence of Ranom digits. The value of the Ranom number is calculated as follows: the values of all digits are summed up, but some digits are taken with negative signs: a digit is taken with negative sign if there is a digit with a strictly greater value to the right of it (not necessarily immediately after it); otherwise, that digit is taken with a positive sign.For example, the value of the Ranom number DAAABDCA is $$$1000 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 10 + 1000 + 100 + 1 = 2088$$$.You are given a Ranom number. You can change no more than one digit in it. Calculate the maximum possible value of the resulting number.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) consisting of uppercase Latin letters from A to E — the Ranom number you are given.The sum of the string lengths over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible value of the number, if you can change no more than one digit in it.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first example, you can get EAAABDCA with the value $$$10000-1-1-1-10+1000+100+1=11088$$$.In the second example, you can get EB with the value $$$10000+10=10010$$$.
