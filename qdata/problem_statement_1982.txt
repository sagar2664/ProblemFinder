A. Integer Diversitytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. You choose any subset of the given numbers (possibly, none or all numbers) and negate these numbers (i. e. change $$$x \to (-x)$$$). What is the maximum number of different values in the array you can achieve?InputThe first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$): the number of test cases.The next lines contain the description of the $$$t$$$ test cases, two lines per a test case.In the first line you are given one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100$$$): the number of integers in the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-100 \leq a_i \leq 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of different elements in the array that you can achieve negating numbers in the array.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first example we can, for example, negate the first and the last numbers, achieving the array $$$[-1, 1, 2, -2]$$$ with four different values.In the second example all three numbers are already different.In the third example negation does not change anything.
