E. Eating Queriestime limit per test3.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTimur has $$$n$$$ candies. The $$$i$$$-th candy has a quantity of sugar equal to $$$a_i$$$. So, by eating the $$$i$$$-th candy, Timur consumes a quantity of sugar equal to $$$a_i$$$.Timur will ask you $$$q$$$ queries regarding his candies. For the $$$j$$$-th query you have to answer what is the minimum number of candies he needs to eat in order to reach a quantity of sugar greater than or equal to $$$x_j$$$ or print -1 if it's not possible to obtain such a quantity. In other words, you should print the minimum possible $$$k$$$ such that after eating $$$k$$$ candies, Timur consumes a quantity of sugar of at least $$$x_j$$$ or say that no possible $$$k$$$ exists.Note that he can't eat the same candy twice and queries are independent of each other (Timur can use the same candy in different queries).InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, q \leq 1.5\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of candies Timur has and the number of queries you have to print an answer for respectively.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4$$$) — the quantity of sugar in each of the candies respectively.Then $$$q$$$ lines follow. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$x_j$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_j \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$$$) – the quantity Timur wants to reach for the given query.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$1.5 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output $$$q$$$ lines. For the $$$j$$$-th line output the number of candies Timur needs to eat in order to reach a quantity of sugar greater than or equal to $$$x_j$$$ or print -1 if it's not possible to obtain such a quantity.ExampleInput

NoteFor the first test case:For the first query, Timur can eat any candy, and he will reach the desired quantity.For the second query, Timur can reach a quantity of at least $$$10$$$ by eating the $$$7$$$-th and the $$$8$$$-th candies, thus consuming a quantity of sugar equal to $$$14$$$.For the third query, there is no possible answer.For the fourth query, Timur can reach a quantity of at least $$$14$$$ by eating the $$$7$$$-th and the $$$8$$$-th candies, thus consuming a quantity of sugar equal to $$$14$$$.For the second test case:For the only query of the second test case, we can choose the third candy from which Timur receives exactly $$$3$$$ sugar. It's also possible to obtain the same answer by choosing the fourth candy.
