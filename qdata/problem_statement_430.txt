A. Don't Try to Counttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven a string $$$x$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$m$$$ ($$$n \cdot m \le 25$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters, you can apply any number of operations to the string $$$x$$$.In one operation, you append the current value of $$$x$$$ to the end of the string $$$x$$$. Note that the value of $$$x$$$ will change after this.For example, if $$$x =$$$"aba", then after applying operations, $$$x$$$ will change as follows: "aba" $$$\rightarrow$$$ "abaaba" $$$\rightarrow$$$ "abaabaabaaba".After what minimum number of operations $$$s$$$ will appear in $$$x$$$ as a substring? A substring of a string is defined as a contiguous segment of it.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \cdot m \le 25$$$) — the lengths of strings $$$x$$$ and $$$s$$$, respectively.The second line of each test case contains the string $$$x$$$ of length $$$n$$$.The third line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$m$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single number — the minimum number of operations after which $$$s$$$ will appear in $$$x$$$ as a substring. If this is not possible, output $$$-1$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case of the example, after $$$2$$$ operations, the string will become "aaaa", and after $$$3$$$ operations, it will become "aaaaaaaa", so the answer is $$$3$$$.In the second test case of the example, after applying $$$1$$$ operation, the string will become "$$$\text{e}\color{red}{\text{force}}\text{forc}$$$", where the substring is highlighted in red.In the fourth test case of the example, it can be shown that it is impossible to obtain the desired string as a substring.
