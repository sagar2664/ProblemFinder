Unfortunately, its piloting system was corrupted and now you need to fix it in order to reach Planetforces.  Space can be represented as the $$$XY$$$ plane. You are starting at point $$$(0, 0)$$$, and Planetforces is located in point $$$(p_x, p_y)$$$.The piloting system of your spaceship follows its list of orders which can be represented as a string $$$s$$$. The system reads $$$s$$$ from left to right. Suppose you are at point $$$(x, y)$$$ and current order is $$$s_i$$$:   if $$$s_i = \text{U}$$$, you move to $$$(x, y + 1)$$$;  if $$$s_i = \text{D}$$$, you move to $$$(x, y - 1)$$$;  if $$$s_i = \text{R}$$$, you move to $$$(x + 1, y)$$$;  if $$$s_i = \text{L}$$$, you move to $$$(x - 1, y)$$$. Since string $$$s$$$ could be corrupted, there is a possibility that you won't reach Planetforces in the end. Fortunately, you can delete some orders from $$$s$$$ but you can't change their positions.Can you delete several orders (possibly, zero) from $$$s$$$ in such a way, that you'll reach Planetforces after the system processes all orders?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line in each test case contains two integers $$$p_x$$$ and $$$p_y$$$ ($$$-10^5 \le p_x, p_y \le 10^5$$$; $$$(p_x, p_y) \neq (0, 0)$$$) — the coordinates of Planetforces $$$(p_x, p_y)$$$.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 10^5$$$: $$$|s|$$$ is the length of string $$$s$$$) — the list of orders.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print "YES" if you can delete several orders (possibly, zero) from $$$s$$$ in such a way, that you'll reach Planetforces. Otherwise, print "NO". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first case, you don't need to modify $$$s$$$, since the given $$$s$$$ will bring you to Planetforces.In the second case, you can delete orders $$$s_2$$$, $$$s_3$$$, $$$s_4$$$, $$$s_6$$$, $$$s_7$$$ and $$$s_8$$$, so $$$s$$$ becomes equal to "UR".In the third test case, you have to delete order $$$s_9$$$, otherwise, you won't finish in the position of Planetforces.
