F. XOR Partitiontime limit per test7 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor a set of integers $$$S$$$, let's define its cost as the minimum value of $$$x \oplus y$$$ among all pairs of different integers from the set (here, $$$\oplus$$$ denotes bitwise XOR). If there are less than two elements in the set, its cost is equal to $$$2^{30}$$$.You are given a set of integers $$$\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$$$. You have to partition it into two sets $$$S_1$$$ and $$$S_2$$$ in such a way that every element of the given set belongs to exactly one of these two sets. The value of the partition is the minimum among the costs of $$$S_1$$$ and $$$S_2$$$.Find the partition with the maximum possible value.InputThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 200000$$$) — the number of elements in the set.The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i < 2^{30}$$$) — the elements of the set.OutputPrint a string $$$n$$$ characters 0 and/or 1 describing the partition as follows: the $$$i$$$-th character should be 0 if the element $$$a_i$$$ belongs to $$$S_1$$$, otherwise, that character should be 1.If there are multiple optimal answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput542 13 1337 37 152Output10001Input41 2 3 4Output1100Input21 2Output10Input87 6 5 4 3 2 1 0Output10010110
