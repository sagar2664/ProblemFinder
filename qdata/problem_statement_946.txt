A. Yet Another Promotiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe famous store "Second Food" sells groceries only two days a month. And the prices in each of days differ. You wanted to buy $$$n$$$ kilos of potatoes for a month. You know that on the first day of the month $$$1$$$ kilo of potatoes costs $$$a$$$ coins, and on the second day $$$b$$$ coins. In "Second Food" you can buy any integer kilograms of potatoes.Fortunately, "Second Food" has announced a promotion for potatoes, which is valid only on the first day of the month — for each $$$m$$$ kilos of potatoes you buy, you get $$$1$$$ kilo as a gift! In other words, you can get $$$m + 1$$$ kilograms by paying for $$$m$$$ kilograms.Find the minimum number of coins that you have to spend to buy at least $$$n$$$ kilos of potatoes.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10\,000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ $$$(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9)$$$ — the prices of $$$1$$$ kilo of potatoes on the first and second days, respectively.The second line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9)$$$ — the required amount of potatoes to buy and the amount of potatoes to use the promotion.OutputFor each test case print one integer — the minimum number of coins that you have to pay to buy at least $$$n$$$ kilos of potatoes.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, on the first day you buy $$$1$$$ kilo and get $$$1$$$ more for a promotion. On the second day, you can buy $$$1$$$ kilo of potatoes. Thus, you will spend $$$5+4=9$$$ coins in total.In the second test case, on the first day you buy $$$2$$$ kilo and get another $$$1$$$ more for a promotion. This way you will spend $$$2 \cdot 5 = 10$$$ coins.
