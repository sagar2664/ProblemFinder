E. ace5 and Task Ordertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem!In the new round, there were $$$n$$$ tasks with difficulties from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The coordinator, who decided to have the first round with tasks in unsorted order of difficulty, rearranged the tasks, resulting in a permutation of difficulties from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. After that, the coordinator challenged ace5 to guess the permutation in the following way.Initially, the coordinator chooses a number $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.ace5 can make queries of the form: $$$?\ i$$$. The answer will be:   $$$>$$$, if $$$a_i > x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ increases by $$$1$$$.  $$$<$$$, if $$$a_i < x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ decreases by $$$1$$$.  $$$=$$$, if $$$a_i = x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ remains unchanged. The task for ace5 is to guess the permutation in no more than $$$40n$$$ queries. Since ace5 is too busy writing the announcement, he has entrusted this task to you.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.InteractionThe interaction between your program and the jury's program begins with reading a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2000$$$) — the length of the hidden permutation.To make a query, output a line in the format "? i", where $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$.As an answer, you will receive:   ">", if $$$a_i$$$ > $$$x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ will increase by $$$1$$$.  "<", if $$$a_i$$$ < $$$x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ will decrease by $$$1$$$.  "=", if $$$a_i$$$ = $$$x$$$, after which $$$x$$$ will remain unchanged. You can make no more than $$$40n$$$ queries. To output the answer, you need to print "! a_1 a_2 ... a_n", where $$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$, and all of them are distinct. Outputting the answer does not count as a query.If your program makes more than $$$40n$$$ queries for one test case, or makes an invalid query, then the response to the query will be -1. After receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict Wrong Answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.After outputting a query, do not forget to print a newline and flush the output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Presentation Error. To flush the buffer, use: fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; System.out.flush() in Java; flush(output) in Pascal; stdout.flush() in Python; see the documentation for other languages.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$. The interactor in this problem is not adaptive.Hacks:To make a hack, use the following format:The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ — the number of test cases.The description of each test case should consist of two lines. The first line contains the numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq x \leq n \leq 2000$$$) — the length of the hidden permutation and the initial value of the number $$$x$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$) — the permutation that the jury should choose in this test case.Sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases should not exceed $$$2000$$$.ExampleInput
