C. Binary String Copyingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters 0 and/or 1.You make $$$m$$$ copies of this string, let the $$$i$$$-th copy be the string $$$t_i$$$. Then you perform exactly one operation on each of the copies: for the $$$i$$$-th copy, you sort its substring $$$[l_i; r_i]$$$ (the substring from the $$$l_i$$$-th character to the $$$r_i$$$-th character, both endpoints inclusive). Note that each operation affects only one copy, and each copy is affected by only one operation.Your task is to calculate the number of different strings among $$$t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m$$$. Note that the initial string $$$s$$$ should be counted only if at least one of the copies stays the same after the operation.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$s$$$ and the number of copies, respectively.The second line contains $$$n$$$ characters 0 and/or 1 — the string $$$s$$$.Then $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$) — the description of the operation applied to the $$$i$$$-th copy.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. The sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the number of different strings among $$$t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m$$$.ExampleInput

NoteConsider the first example. Copies below are given in order of the input operations. Underlined substrings are substrings that are sorted:  101100 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 011100;  101100 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 011100;  101100 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 101100;  101100 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 101100;  101100 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 000111. There are three different strings among $$$t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5$$$: 000111, 011100 and 101100.Consider the second example:  100111 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 100111;  100111 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 001111;  100111 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 001111;  100111 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 010111. There are three different strings among $$$t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4$$$: 001111, 010111 and 100111.
