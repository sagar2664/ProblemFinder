C. Hossam and Traineestime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHossam has $$$n$$$ trainees. He assigned a number $$$a_i$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th trainee. A pair of the $$$i$$$-th and $$$j$$$-th ($$$i \neq j$$$) trainees is called successful if there is an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$x \geq 2$$$), such that $$$x$$$ divides $$$a_i$$$, and $$$x$$$ divides $$$a_j$$$.Hossam wants to know if there is a successful pair of trainees.Hossam is very tired now, so he asks you for your help!InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$), the number of test cases. A description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers, the number of each trainee $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputPrint the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if there is a successful pair of trainees and "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.ExampleInput
2332 48 7314 5 9Output
YES
NO
NoteIn the first example, the first trainee and the second trainee make up a successful pair: $$$a_1 = 32, a_2 = 48$$$, you can choose $$$x = 4$$$.
