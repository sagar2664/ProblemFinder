B. Anti-Fibonacci Permutationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ anti-Fibonacci if the condition $$$p_{i-2} + p_{i-1} \ne p_i$$$ holds for all $$$i$$$ ($$$3 \le i \le n$$$). Recall that the permutation is the array of length $$$n$$$ which contains each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ exactly once.Your task is for a given number $$$n$$$ print $$$n$$$ distinct anti-Fibonacci permutations of length $$$n$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 48$$$) — the number of test cases. The single line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 50$$$).OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ lines. Each line should contain an anti-Fibonacci permutation of length $$$n$$$. In each test case, you cannot print any permutation more than once.If there are multiple answers, print any of them. It can be shown that it is always possible to find $$$n$$$ different anti-Fibonacci permutations of size $$$n$$$ under the constraints of the problem.ExampleInput
