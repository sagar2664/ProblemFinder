B. JoJo's Incredible Adventurestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDid you think there was going to be a JoJo legend here? But no, that was me, Dio!Given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of characters 0 and 1. Let's build a square table of size $$$n \times n$$$, consisting of 0 and 1 characters as follows.In the first row of the table write the original string $$$s$$$. In the second row of the table write cyclic shift of the string $$$s$$$ by one to the right. In the third row of the table, write the cyclic shift of line $$$s$$$ by two to the right. And so on. Thus, the row with number $$$k$$$ will contain a cyclic shift of string $$$s$$$ by $$$k$$$ to the right. The rows are numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$ top-to-bottom.In the resulting table we need to find the rectangle consisting only of ones that has the largest area.We call a rectangle the set of all cells $$$(i, j)$$$ in the table, such that $$$x_1 \le i \le x_2$$$ and $$$y_1 \le j \le y_2$$$ for some integers $$$0 \le x_1 \le x_2 < n$$$ and $$$0 \le y_1 \le y_2 < n$$$.Recall that the cyclic shift of string $$$s$$$ by $$$k$$$ to the right is the string $$$s_{n-k+1} \ldots s_n s_1 s_2 \ldots s_{n-k}$$$. For example, the cyclic shift of the string "01011" by $$$0$$$ to the right is the string itself "01011", its cyclic shift by $$$3$$$ to the right is the string "01101".InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first and the only line of each test case contains a single binary string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le \lvert s \rvert \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$), consisting of characters 0 and 1.It is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum area of a rectangle consisting only of ones. If there is no such rectangle, output $$$0$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, there is a table $$$1 \times 1$$$ consisting of a single character 0, so there are no rectangles consisting of ones, and the answer is $$$0$$$.In the second test case, there is a table $$$1 \times 1$$$, consisting of a single character 1, so the answer is $$$1$$$.In the third test case, there is a table: 101110011 In the fourth test case, there is a table: 011110001111100111110011111001111100 In the fifth test case, there is a table: 101010010101101010010101101010010101 Rectangles with maximum area are shown in bold.
