B. Raintime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are the owner of a harvesting field which can be modeled as an infinite line, whose positions are identified by integers.It will rain for the next $$$n$$$ days. On the $$$i$$$-th day, the rain will be centered at position $$$x_i$$$ and it will have intensity $$$p_i$$$. Due to these rains, some rainfall will accumulate; let $$$a_j$$$ be the amount of rainfall accumulated at integer position $$$j$$$. Initially $$$a_j$$$ is $$$0$$$, and it will increase by $$$\max(0,p_i-|x_i-j|)$$$ after the $$$i$$$-th day's rain.A flood will hit your field if, at any moment, there is a position $$$j$$$ with accumulated rainfall $$$a_j>m$$$.You can use a magical spell to erase exactly one day's rain, i.e., setting $$$p_i=0$$$. For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, check whether in case of erasing the $$$i$$$-th day's rain there is no flood.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq m \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of rainy days and the maximal accumulated rainfall with no flood occurring.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_i,p_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the position and intensity of the $$$i$$$-th day's rain.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a binary string $$$s$$$ length of $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ is 1 if after erasing the $$$i$$$-th day's rain there is no flood, while it is 0, if after erasing the $$$i$$$-th day's rain the flood still happens.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, if we do not use the spell, the accumulated rainfall distribution will be like this:  If we erase the third day's rain, the flood is avoided and the accumulated rainfall distribution looks like this:  In the second test case, since initially the flood will not happen, we can erase any day's rain.In the third test case, there is no way to avoid the flood.
