You have to evaluate it and print the result.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing an expression of the form $$$a{+}b$$$ ($$$0 \le a, b \le 9$$$, both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are integers). The integers are not separated from the $$$+$$$ sign.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the result of the expression.ExampleInput
