G. Predictiontime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider a tournament with $$$n$$$ participants. The rating of the $$$i$$$-th participant is $$$a_i$$$.The tournament will be organized as follows. First of all, organizers will assign each participant an index from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. All indices will be unique. Let $$$p_i$$$ be the participant who gets the index $$$i$$$.Then, $$$n-1$$$ games will be held. In the first game, participants $$$p_1$$$ and $$$p_2$$$ will play. In the second game, the winner of the first game will play against $$$p_3$$$. In the third game, the winner of the second game will play against $$$p_4$$$, and so on — in the last game, the winner of the $$$(n-2)$$$-th game will play against $$$p_n$$$.Monocarp wants to predict the results of all $$$n-1$$$ games (of course, he will do the prediction only after the indices of the participants are assigned). He knows for sure that, when two participants with ratings $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ play, and $$$|x - y| > k$$$, the participant with the higher rating wins. But if $$$|x - y| \le k$$$, any of the two participants may win.Among all $$$n!$$$ ways to assign the indices to participants, calculate the number of ways to do this so that Monocarp can predict the results of all $$$n-1$$$ games. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^6$$$; $$$0 \le k \le 10^9$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_n \le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint one integer — the number of ways to assign the indices to the participants so that Monocarp can predict the results of all $$$n-1$$$ games.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first example, a match with any pair of players can be predicted by Monocarp, so all $$$24$$$ ways to assign indices should be counted.In the second example, suitable ways are $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$, $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$, $$$[3, 1, 2$$$] and $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$.
