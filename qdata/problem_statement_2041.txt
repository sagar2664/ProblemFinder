A. Find Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven $$$n$$$, find any array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of integers such that all of the following conditions hold: $$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$ for every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.$$$a_1 < a_2 < \ldots <a_n$$$For every $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n$$$, $$$a_i$$$ isn't divisible by $$$a_{i-1}$$$It can be shown that such an array always exists under the constraints of the problem.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ — the array you found. If there are multiple arrays satisfying all the conditions, print any of them.ExampleInput
