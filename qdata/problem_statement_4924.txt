As soon as Byteland Botanical Garden announced Summer Oenothera Exhibition she decided to test her new camera there.The exhibition consists of $$$l = 10^{100}$$$ Oenothera species arranged in a row and consecutively numbered with integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$l - 1$$$. Camera lens allows to take a photo of $$$w$$$ species on it, i.e. Dina can take a photo containing flowers with indices from $$$x$$$ to $$$x + w - 1$$$ for some integer $$$x$$$ between $$$0$$$ and $$$l - w$$$. We will denote such photo with $$$[x, x + w - 1]$$$.She has taken $$$n$$$ photos, the $$$i$$$-th of which (in chronological order) is $$$[x_i, x_i + w - 1]$$$ in our notation. She decided to build a time-lapse video from these photos once she discovered that Oenothera blossoms open in the evening. Dina takes each photo and truncates it, leaving its segment containing exactly $$$k$$$ flowers, then she composes a video of these photos keeping their original order and voilà, a beautiful artwork has been created!A scene is a contiguous sequence of photos such that the set of flowers on them is the same. The change between two scenes is called a cut. For example, consider the first photo contains flowers $$$[1, 5]$$$, the second photo contains flowers $$$[3, 7]$$$ and the third photo contains flowers $$$[8, 12]$$$. If $$$k = 3$$$, then Dina can truncate the first and the second photo into $$$[3, 5]$$$, and the third photo into $$$[9, 11]$$$. First two photos form a scene, third photo also forms a scene and the transition between these two scenes which happens between the second and the third photos is a cut. If $$$k = 4$$$, then each of the transitions between photos has to be a cut.Dina wants the number of cuts to be as small as possible. Please help her! Calculate the minimum possible number of cuts for different values of $$$k$$$.InputThe first line contains three positive integer $$$n$$$, $$$w$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, q \leq 100\,000$$$, $$$1 \leq w \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of taken photos, the number of flowers on a single photo and the number of queries.Next line contains $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$x_i$$$ ($$$0 \le x_i \le 10^9$$$) — the indices of the leftmost flowers on each of the photos.Next line contains $$$q$$$ positive integers $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \le k_i \le w$$$) — the values of $$$k$$$ for which you have to solve the problem.It's guaranteed that all $$$k_i$$$ are distinct.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ integers — for each width of the truncated photo $$$k_i$$$, the minimum number of cuts that is possible.ExamplesInput3 6 52 4 01 2 3 4 5Output00112Input6 4 31 2 3 4 3 21 2 3Output012
