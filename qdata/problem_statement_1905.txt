A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. You have to assign integer weights to each edge of the tree, such that the resultant graph is a prime tree.A prime tree is a tree where the weight of every path consisting of one or two edges is prime. A path should not visit any vertex twice. The weight of a path is the sum of edge weights on that path.Consider the graph below. It is a prime tree as the weight of every path of two or less edges is prime. For example, the following path of two edges: $$$2 \to 1 \to 3$$$ has a weight of $$$11 + 2 = 13$$$, which is prime. Similarly, the path of one edge: $$$4 \to 3$$$ has a weight of $$$5$$$, which is also prime.  Print any valid assignment of weights such that the resultant tree is a prime tree. If there is no such assignment, then print $$$-1$$$. It can be proven that if a valid assignment exists, one exists with weights between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ as well.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.Then, $$$n-1$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$) denoting that edge number $$$i$$$ is between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if a valid assignment exists, then print a single line containing $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \le 10^5$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ denotes the weight assigned to the edge numbered $$$i$$$. Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$.If there are multiple solutions, you may print any.ExampleInput

-1NoteFor the first test case, there are only two paths having one edge each: $$$1 \to 2$$$ and $$$2 \to 1$$$, both having a weight of $$$17$$$, which is prime.  The second test case is described in the statement.It can be proven that no such assignment exists for the third test case.
