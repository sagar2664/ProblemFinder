G. Moving Platformstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a game where you need to move through a labyrinth. The labyrinth consists of $$$n$$$ platforms, connected by $$$m$$$ passages. Each platform is at some level $$$l_i$$$, an integer number from $$$0$$$ to $$$H - 1$$$. In a single step, if you are currently on platform $$$i$$$, you can stay on it, or move to another platform $$$j$$$. To move to platform $$$j$$$ they have to be connected by the passage, and their levels have to be the same, namely $$$l_i = l_j$$$.After each step, the levels of all platforms change. The new level of platform $$$i$$$ is calculated as $$$l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \bmod H$$$, for all $$$i$$$. You start on platform $$$1$$$. Find the minimum number of steps you need to get to platform $$$n$$$.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$H$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le H \le 10^9$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$l_i$$$, the initial level of each platform ($$$0 \le l_i \le H-1$$$). The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_i$$$, the change of level for each platform ($$$0 \le s_i \le H-1$$$).Next $$$m$$$ lines contain a description of the passages. Each passage is described as a pair of integers — the platforms, connected by the passage. There is at most one passage connecting each pair of platforms, and there is no passage connecting a platform to itself.The sum of $$$n$$$ for all tests does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, the sum of $$$m$$$ for all tests does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer, the minimum number of steps needed to get from platform $$$1$$$ to platform $$$n$$$.If it is impossible to get to platform $$$n$$$, print $$$-1$$$.ExampleInput
