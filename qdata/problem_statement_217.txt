D. Yet Another Inversions Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a permutation $$$p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}$$$ of odd integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n-1$$$ and a permutation $$$q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_{k-1}$$$ of integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$k-1$$$.An array $$$a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{nk-1}$$$ of length $$$nk$$$ is defined as follows: $$$a_{i \cdot k+j}=p_i \cdot 2^{q_j}$$$ for all $$$0 \le i < n$$$ and all $$$0 \le j < k$$$ For example, if $$$p = [3, 5, 1]$$$ and $$$q = [0, 1]$$$, then $$$a = [3, 6, 5, 10, 1, 2]$$$.Note that all arrays in the statement are zero-indexed. Note that each element of the array $$$a$$$ is uniquely determined.Find the number of inversions in the array $$$a$$$. Since this number can be very large, you should find only its remainder modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.An inversion in array $$$a$$$ is a pair $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$0 \le i < j < nk$$$) such that $$$a_i > a_j$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the lengths of arrays $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le 2n-1$$$, $$$p_i$$$ is odd) — the array $$$p$$$.The third line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_{k-1}$$$ ($$$0 \le q_i < k$$$) — the array $$$q$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one integer: the number of inversions in array $$$a$$$ modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, array $$$a$$$ is equal to $$$[3, 6, 5, 10, 1, 2]$$$. There are $$$9$$$ inversions in it: $$$(0, 4)$$$, $$$(0, 5)$$$, $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 4)$$$, $$$(1, 5)$$$, $$$(2, 4)$$$, $$$(2, 5)$$$, $$$(3, 4)$$$, $$$(3, 5)$$$. Note that these are pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.In the second test case, array $$$a$$$ is equal to $$$[8, 4, 1, 2, 24, 12, 3, 6, 40, 20, 5, 10]$$$. There are $$$25$$$ inversions in it.In the third test case, array $$$a$$$ is equal to $$$[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]$$$. There are no inversions in it.
