C. Rhymetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's say that two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ rhyme if both strings have length at least $$$k$$$, and their last $$$k$$$ characters are equal. For example, if $$$k = 3$$$, the strings abcd and cebcd rhyme, the strings ab and ab don't rhyme, the strings aaaa and aaaaa rhyme, the strings abcd and abce don't rhyme.You have $$$n$$$ pairs of strings $$$(s_i, t_i)$$$, and for each pair of strings you know, should they rhyme or should not.Find all possible non-negative integer values for $$$k$$$ such that pairs that have to rhyme, rhyme and pairs that must not rhyme, don't rhyme.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of string pairs.Next $$$n$$$ lines contains descriptions of pairs — one per line. The $$$i$$$-th line contains space-separated strings $$$s_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$ and marker $$$r_i$$$. Strings are non-empty, consist of lowercase Latin letters and each have length at most $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. The marker $$$r_i$$$ equals to $$$1$$$ if strings have to rhyme, or $$$0$$$ if they must not rhyme.It's guaranteed that for each test case there is at least one pair with $$$r_i$$$ equal to $$$1$$$ and that the total length of all strings over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$4 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, firstly print integer $$$m$$$ — the number of possible non-negative integer values of $$$k$$$ such that pairs that have to rhyme, rhyme and pairs that must not rhyme, don't rhyme. Next, print all these values of $$$k$$$ (without repetitions). You can print them in any order.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, if $$$k$$$ is at least $$$1$$$ then kotlin and heroes don't rhyme.In the second test case, for $$$k = 2$$$ join and kotlin rhyme, and episode and eight don't rhyme.
