D. The Clocktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVictor has a 24-hour clock that shows the time in the format "HH:MM" (00 $$$\le$$$ HH $$$\le$$$ 23, 00 $$$\le$$$ MM $$$\le$$$ 59). He looks at the clock every $$$x$$$ minutes, and the clock is currently showing time $$$s$$$. How many different palindromes will Victor see in total after looking at the clock every $$$x$$$ minutes, the first time being at time $$$s$$$?For example, if the clock starts out as 03:12 and Victor looks at the clock every $$$360$$$ minutes (i.e. every $$$6$$$ hours), then he will see the times 03:12, 09:12, 15:12, 21:12, 03:12, and the times will continue to repeat. Here the time 21:12 is the only palindrome he will ever see, so the answer is $$$1$$$.A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the times 12:21, 05:50, 11:11 are palindromes but 13:13, 22:10, 02:22 are not.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$5$$$ with the format "HH:MM" where "HH" is from "00" to "23" and "MM" is from "00" to "59" (both "HH" and "MM" have exactly two digits) and an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq x \leq 1440$$$) — the number of minutes Victor takes to look again at the clock.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of different palindromes Victor will see if he looks at the clock every $$$x$$$ minutes starting from time $$$s$$$.ExampleInput
