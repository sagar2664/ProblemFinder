D. Permutation Restorationtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp had a permutation $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once).Then Monocarp calculated an array of integers $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where $$$b_i = \left\lfloor \frac{i}{a_i} \right\rfloor$$$. For example, if the permutation $$$a$$$ is $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$, then the array $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$\left[ \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{2}{1} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{3}{4} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{4}{3} \right\rfloor \right] = [0, 2, 0, 1]$$$.Unfortunately, the Monocarp has lost his permutation, so he wants to restore it. Your task is to find a permutation $$$a$$$ that corresponds to the given array $$$b$$$. If there are multiple possible permutations, then print any of them. The tests are constructed in such a way that least one suitable permutation exists.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \le b_i \le n$$$).Additional constrains on the input:  the sum of $$$n$$$ over test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$;  there exists at least one permutation $$$a$$$ that would yield this array $$$b$$$. OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers — a permutation $$$a$$$ that corresponds to the given array $$$b$$$. If there are multiple possible permutations, then print any of them.ExampleInput
