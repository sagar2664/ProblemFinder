B. A Balanced Problemset?time limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputJay managed to create a problem of difficulty $$$x$$$ and decided to make it the second problem for Codeforces Round #921. But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a problemset of $$$n$$$ sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to $$$x$$$. The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset. Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties of the sub-problems optimally.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\leq t\leq 10^3$$$) denoting the number of test cases.Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers $$$x$$$ ($$$1\leq x\leq 10^8$$$) and $$$n$$$ ($$$1\leq n\leq x$$$).OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.ExampleInput

NoteFor the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of difficulty $$$10$$$ into a problemset having three problems of difficulties $$$4$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ respectively, giving a balance equal to $$$2$$$.For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of difficulty $$$5$$$ into a problemset of $$$5$$$ problems with each problem having a difficulty $$$1$$$ giving a balance equal to $$$1$$$.
