F. New Year and Social Networktime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDonghyun's new social network service (SNS) contains $$$n$$$ users numbered $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$. Internally, their network is a tree graph, so there are $$$n-1$$$ direct connections between each user. Each user can reach every other users by using some sequence of direct connections. From now on, we will denote this primary network as $$$T_1$$$.To prevent a possible server breakdown, Donghyun created a backup network $$$T_2$$$, which also connects the same $$$n$$$ users via a tree graph. If a system breaks down, exactly one edge $$$e \in T_1$$$ becomes unusable. In this case, Donghyun will protect the edge $$$e$$$ by picking another edge $$$f \in T_2$$$, and add it to the existing network. This new edge should make the network be connected again. Donghyun wants to assign a replacement edge $$$f \in T_2$$$ for as many edges $$$e \in T_1$$$ as possible. However, since the backup network $$$T_2$$$ is fragile, $$$f \in T_2$$$ can be assigned as the replacement edge for at most one edge in $$$T_1$$$. With this restriction, Donghyun wants to protect as many edges in $$$T_1$$$ as possible.Formally, let $$$E(T)$$$ be an edge set of the tree $$$T$$$. We consider a bipartite graph with two parts $$$E(T_1)$$$ and $$$E(T_2)$$$. For $$$e \in E(T_1), f \in E(T_2)$$$, there is an edge connecting $$$\{e, f\}$$$ if and only if graph $$$T_1 - \{e\} + \{f\}$$$ is a tree. You should find a maximum matching in this bipartite graph.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 250\,000$$$), the number of users. In the next $$$n-1$$$ lines, two integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$$$) are given. Those two numbers denote the indices of the vertices connected by the corresponding edge in $$$T_1$$$.In the next $$$n-1$$$ lines, two integers $$$c_i$$$, $$$d_i$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i, d_i \le n$$$) are given. Those two numbers denote the indices of the vertices connected by the corresponding edge in $$$T_2$$$. It is guaranteed that both edge sets form a tree of size $$$n$$$.OutputIn the first line, print the number $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \leq m < n$$$), the maximum number of edges that can be protected.In the next $$$m$$$ lines, print four integers $$$a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$$$. Those four numbers denote that the edge $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ in $$$T_1$$$ is will be replaced with an edge $$$(c_i, d_i)$$$ in $$$T_2$$$.All printed edges should belong to their respective network, and they should link to distinct edges in their respective network. If one removes an edge $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ from $$$T_1$$$ and adds edge $$$(c_i, d_i)$$$ from $$$T_2$$$, the network should remain connected. The order of printing the edges or the order of vertices in each edge does not matter.If there are several solutions, you can print any.ExamplesInput
