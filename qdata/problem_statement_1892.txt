A. And Matchingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a set of $$$n$$$ ($$$n$$$ is always a power of $$$2$$$) elements containing all integers $$$0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$$$ exactly once.Find $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ pairs of elements such that:  Each element in the set is in exactly one pair.  The sum over all pairs of the bitwise AND of its elements must be exactly equal to $$$k$$$. Formally, if $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ are the elements of the $$$i$$$-th pair, then the following must hold: $$$$$$\sum_{i=1}^{n/2}{a_i \& b_i} = k,$$$$$$ where $$$\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation. If there are many solutions, print any of them, if there is no solution, print $$$-1$$$ instead.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 400$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.Each test case consists of a single line with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$4 \leq n \leq 2^{16}$$$, $$$n$$$ is a power of $$$2$$$, $$$0 \leq k \leq n-1$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2^{16}$$$. All test cases in each individual input will be pairwise different.OutputFor each test case, if there is no solution, print a single line with the integer $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of them must contain $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$, the elements in the $$$i$$$-th pair. If there are many solutions, print any of them. Print the pairs and the elements in the pairs in any order.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test, $$$(0\&3)+(1\&2) = 0$$$.In the second test, $$$(0\&2)+(1\&3) = 1$$$.In the third test, $$$(0\&1)+(2\&3) = 2$$$.In the fourth test, there is no solution.
