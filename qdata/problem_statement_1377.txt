C. Word Gametime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThree guys play a game: first, each person writes down $$$n$$$ distinct words of length $$$3$$$. Then, they total up the number of points as follows:   if a word was written by one person — that person gets 3 points,  if a word was written by two people — each of the two gets 1 point,  if a word was written by all — nobody gets any points.  In the end, how many points does each player have?InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 1000$$$) — the number of words written by each person.The following three lines each contain $$$n$$$ distinct strings — the words written by each person. Each string consists of $$$3$$$ lowercase English characters.OutputFor each test case, output three space-separated integers — the number of points each of the three guys earned. You should output the answers in the same order as the input; the $$$i$$$-th integer should be the number of points earned by the $$$i$$$-th guy.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case:   The word $$$\texttt{abc}$$$ was written by the first and third guys — they each get $$$1$$$ point.  The word $$$\texttt{def}$$$ was written by the second guy only — he gets $$$3$$$ points.
