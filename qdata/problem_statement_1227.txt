B. BAN BANtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$n$$$.Let's define $$$s(n)$$$ as the string "BAN" concatenated $$$n$$$ times. For example, $$$s(1)$$$ = "BAN", $$$s(3)$$$ = "BANBANBAN". Note that the length of the string $$$s(n)$$$ is equal to $$$3n$$$.Consider $$$s(n)$$$. You can perform the following operation on $$$s(n)$$$ any number of times (possibly zero): Select any two distinct indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ $$$(1 \leq i, j \leq 3n, i \ne j)$$$. Then, swap $$$s(n)_i$$$ and $$$s(n)_j$$$. You want the string "BAN" to not appear in $$$s(n)$$$ as a subsequence. What's the smallest number of operations you have to do to achieve this? Also, find one such shortest sequence of operations.A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \leq t \leq 100)$$$  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \leq n \leq 100)$$$.OutputFor each test case, in the first line output $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \le m \le 10^5$$$) — the minimum number of operations required. It's guaranteed that the objective is always achievable in at most $$$10^5$$$ operations under the constraints of the problem. Then, output $$$m$$$ lines. The $$$k$$$-th of these lines should contain two integers $$$i_k$$$, $$$j_k$$$ $$$(1\leq i_k, j_k \leq 3n, i_k \ne j_k)$$$ denoting that you want to swap characters at indices $$$i_k$$$ and $$$j_k$$$ at the $$$k$$$-th operation. After all $$$m$$$ operations, "BAN" must not appear in $$$s(n)$$$ as a subsequence. If there are multiple possible answers, output any.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase, $$$s(1) = $$$ "BAN", we can swap $$$s(1)_1$$$ and $$$s(1)_2$$$, converting $$$s(1)$$$ to "ABN", which does not contain "BAN" as a subsequence.In the second testcase, $$$s(2) = $$$ "BANBAN", we can swap $$$s(2)_2$$$ and $$$s(2)_6$$$, converting $$$s(2)$$$ to "BNNBAA", which does not contain "BAN" as a subsequence.
