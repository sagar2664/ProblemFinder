C. Array Gametime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. In one operation, you must pick some $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$1\leq i < j\leq |a|$$$ and append $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$ to the end of the $$$a$$$ (i.e. increase $$$n$$$ by $$$1$$$ and set $$$a_n$$$ to $$$|a_i - a_j|$$$). Your task is to minimize and print the minimum value of $$$a$$$ after performing $$$k$$$ operations.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 2\cdot 10^3$$$, $$$1\le k\le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the number of operations you should perform.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le 10^{18}$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\cdot 10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the smallest possible value of the minimum of array $$$a$$$ after performing $$$k$$$ operations.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, after any $$$k=2$$$ operations, the minimum value of $$$a$$$ will be $$$1$$$.In the second test case, an optimal strategy is to first pick $$$i=1, j=2$$$ and append $$$|a_1 - a_2| = 3$$$ to the end of $$$a$$$, creating $$$a=[7, 4, 15, 12, 3]$$$. Then, pick $$$i=3, j=4$$$ and append $$$|a_3 - a_4| = 3$$$ to the end of $$$a$$$, creating $$$a=[7, 4, 15, 12, 3, 3]$$$. In the final operation, pick $$$i=5, j=6$$$ and append $$$|a_5 - a_6| = 0$$$ to the end of $$$a$$$. Then the minimum value of $$$a$$$ will be $$$0$$$.In the third test case, an optimal strategy is to first pick $$$i=2, j=3$$$ to append $$$|a_2 - a_3| = 3$$$ to the end of $$$a$$$. Any second operation will still not make the minimum value of $$$a$$$ be less than $$$3$$$.
