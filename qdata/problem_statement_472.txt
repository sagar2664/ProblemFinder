F. Selling a Menagerietime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are the owner of a menagerie consisting of $$$n$$$ animals numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. However, maintaining the menagerie is quite expensive, so you have decided to sell it!It is known that each animal is afraid of exactly one other animal. More precisely, animal $$$i$$$ is afraid of animal $$$a_i$$$ ($$$a_i \neq i$$$). Also, the cost of each animal is known, for animal $$$i$$$ it is equal to $$$c_i$$$.You will sell all your animals in some fixed order. Formally, you will need to choose some permutation$$$^\dagger$$$ $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$, and sell animal $$$p_1$$$ first, then animal $$$p_2$$$, and so on, selling animal $$$p_n$$$ last.When you sell animal $$$i$$$, there are two possible outcomes: If animal $$$a_i$$$ was sold before animal $$$i$$$, you receive $$$c_i$$$ money for selling animal $$$i$$$. If animal $$$a_i$$$ was not sold before animal $$$i$$$, you receive $$$2 \cdot c_i$$$ money for selling animal $$$i$$$. (Surprisingly, animals that are currently afraid are more valuable). Your task is to choose the order of selling the animals in order to maximize the total profit. For example, if $$$a = [3, 4, 4, 1, 3]$$$, $$$c = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$$$, and the permutation you choose is $$$[4, 2, 5, 1, 3]$$$, then: The first animal to be sold is animal $$$4$$$. Animal $$$a_4 = 1$$$ was not sold before, so you receive $$$2 \cdot c_4 = 12$$$ money for selling it. The second animal to be sold is animal $$$2$$$. Animal $$$a_2 = 4$$$ was sold before, so you receive $$$c_2 = 4$$$ money for selling it. The third animal to be sold is animal $$$5$$$. Animal $$$a_5 = 3$$$ was not sold before, so you receive $$$2 \cdot c_5 = 14$$$ money for selling it. The fourth animal to be sold is animal $$$1$$$. Animal $$$a_1 = 3$$$ was not sold before, so you receive $$$2 \cdot c_1 = 6$$$ money for selling it. The fifth animal to be sold is animal $$$3$$$. Animal $$$a_3 = 4$$$ was sold before, so you receive $$$c_3 = 5$$$ money for selling it.Your total profit, with this choice of permutation, is $$$12 + 4 + 14 + 6 + 5 = 41$$$. Note that $$$41$$$ is not the maximum possible profit in this example.$$$^\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in any order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$, but $$$4$$$ is present in the array).InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case description contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of animals.The second line of the test case description contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$, $$$a_i \neq i$$$) — $$$a_i$$$ means the index of the animal that animal $$$i$$$ is afraid of.The third line of the test case description contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le 10^9$$$) — the costs of the animals.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer should be $$$n$$$ integers — the permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$, indicating in which order to sell the animals in order to maximize the profit. If there are multiple possible answers, you can output any of them.ExampleInput
