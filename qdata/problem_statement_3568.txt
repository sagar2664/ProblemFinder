B. WeirdSorttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.You are also given a set of distinct positions $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$$$, where $$$1 \le p_i < n$$$. The position $$$p_i$$$ means that you can swap elements $$$a[p_i]$$$ and $$$a[p_i + 1]$$$. You can apply this operation any number of times for each of the given positions.Your task is to determine if it is possible to sort the initial array in non-decreasing order ($$$a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_n$$$) using only allowed swaps.For example, if $$$a = [3, 2, 1]$$$ and $$$p = [1, 2]$$$, then we can first swap elements $$$a[2]$$$ and $$$a[3]$$$ (because position $$$2$$$ is contained in the given set $$$p$$$). We get the array $$$a = [3, 1, 2]$$$. Then we swap $$$a[1]$$$ and $$$a[2]$$$ (position $$$1$$$ is also contained in $$$p$$$). We get the array $$$a = [1, 3, 2]$$$. Finally, we swap $$$a[2]$$$ and $$$a[3]$$$ again and get the array $$$a = [1, 2, 3]$$$, sorted in non-decreasing order.You can see that if $$$a = [4, 1, 2, 3]$$$ and $$$p = [3, 2]$$$ then you cannot sort the array.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m < n \le 100$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$ and the number of elements in $$$p$$$. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 100$$$). The third line of the test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i < n$$$, all $$$p_i$$$ are distinct) — the set of positions described in the problem statement.OutputFor each test case, print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if you can sort the initial array in non-decreasing order ($$$a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_n$$$) using only allowed swaps. Otherwise, print "NO".ExampleInput
