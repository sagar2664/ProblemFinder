A. Consecutive Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ with $$$n$$$ integers. You can perform the following operation at most $$$k$$$ times:  Choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, in which $$$i \,\bmod\, k = j \,\bmod\, k$$$ ($$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$).  Swap $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$. After performing all operations, you have to select $$$k$$$ consecutive elements, and the sum of the $$$k$$$ elements becomes your score. Find the maximum score you can get.Here $$$x \bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 600$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 100$$$) — the length of the array and the number in the statement above.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$)  — the array itself.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum score you can get, one per line.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, we can get a score of $$$11$$$ if we select $$$a_1, a_2$$$ without performing any operations.In the third test case, we can get a score of $$$15$$$ if we first swap $$$a_1$$$ with $$$a_4$$$ and then select $$$a_3, a_4, a_5$$$.
