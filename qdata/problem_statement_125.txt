C. Make Equal Againtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le j \le n$$$) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from $$$i$$$ to $$$j$$$ the value $$$x$$$. The price of this operation depends on the selected indices and is equal to $$$(j - i + 1)$$$ burles. For example, the array is equal to $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]$$$. If we choose $$$i = 2, j = 4, x = 8$$$, then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to $$$[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1]$$$.What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements of the array equal?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5$$$) — the size of the array.The second line of the description of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — array elements.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be shown that this can always be done.ExampleInput
