If no such $$$x$$$ exists, the power is $$$0$$$. Call an array $$$b$$$ a rival to $$$a$$$ if the following holds:   The length of both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are equal to some $$$n$$$.  Over all $$$l, r$$$ where $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$, the power of $$$a_l \dots a_r$$$ equals the power of $$$b_l \dots b_r$$$.  The elements of $$$b$$$ are positive. Ntarsis wants you to find a rival $$$b$$$ to $$$a$$$ such that the sum of $$$b_i$$$ over $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ is maximized. Help him with this task!InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case has a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$).The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ — a valid rival to $$$a$$$ such that $$$b_1 + b_2 + \cdots + b_n$$$ is maximal. If there exist multiple rivals with the maximum sum, output any of them.ExampleInput

NoteFor the first test case, one rival with the maximal sum is $$$[2, 4, 2, 3, 3]$$$.$$$[2, 4, 2, 3, 3]$$$ can be shown to be a rival to $$$[1, 4, 1, 3, 3]$$$.All possible subarrays of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ and their corresponding powers are listed below:   The power of $$$a[1:1] = [1] = 0$$$, the power of $$$b[1:1] = [2] = 0$$$.  The power of $$$a[1:2] = [1, 4] = 4$$$, the power of $$$b[1:2] = [2, 4] = 4$$$.  The power of $$$a[1:3] = [1, 4, 1] = 4$$$, the power of $$$b[1:3] = [2, 4, 2] = 4$$$.  The power of $$$a[1:4] = [1, 4, 1, 3] = 4$$$, the power of $$$b[1:4] = [2, 4, 2, 3] = 4$$$.  The power of $$$a[1:5] = [1, 4, 1, 3, 3] = 4$$$, the power of $$$b[1:5] = [2, 4, 2, 3, 3] = 4$$$.  The power of $$$a[2:2] = [4] = 4$$$, the power of $$$b[2:2] = [4] = 4$$$.  The power of $$$a[2:3] = [4, 1] = 4$$$, the power of $$$b[2:3] = [4, 2] = 4$$$.  The power of $$$a[2:4] = [4, 1, 3] = 4$$$, the power of $$$b[2:4] = [4, 2, 3] = 4$$$.  The power of $$$a[2:5] = [4, 1, 3, 3] = 4$$$, the power of $$$b[2:5] = [4, 2, 3, 3] = 4$$$.  The power of $$$a[3:3] = [1] = 0$$$, the power of $$$b[3:3] = [2] = 0$$$.  The power of $$$a[3:4] = [1, 3] = 0$$$, the power of $$$b[3:4] = [2, 3] = 0$$$.  The power of $$$a[3:5] = [1, 3, 3] = 3$$$, the power of $$$b[3:5] = [2, 3, 3] = 3$$$.  The power of $$$a[4:4] = [3] = 0$$$, the power of $$$b[4:4] = [3] = 0$$$.  The power of $$$a[4:5] = [3, 3] = 3$$$, the power of $$$b[4:5] = [3, 3] = 3$$$.  The power of $$$a[5:5] = [3] = 0$$$, the power of $$$b[5:5] = [3] = 0$$$. It can be shown there exists no rival with a greater sum than $$$2 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14$$$.
