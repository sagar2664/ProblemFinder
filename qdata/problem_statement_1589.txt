C. Bring Balancetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlina has a bracket sequence $$$s$$$ of length $$$2n$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ opening brackets '(' and $$$n$$$ closing brackets ')'. As she likes balance, she wants to turn this bracket sequence into a balanced bracket sequence.In one operation, she can reverse any substring of $$$s$$$.What's the smallest number of operations that she needs to turn $$$s$$$ into a balanced bracket sequence? It can be shown that it's always possible in at most $$$n$$$ operations.As a reminder, a sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters + and 1. For example, sequences (())(), (), and (()(())) are balanced, while )(, ((), and (()))( are not.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$2n$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ opening and $$$n$$$ closing brackets.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, in the first line output a single integer $$$k$$$ $$$(0 \le k \le n)$$$  — the smallest number of operations required.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$k$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$l_i, r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 2n$$$), indicating that in the $$$i$$$-th operation, Alina will reverse the substring $$$s_ls_{l+1} \ldots s_{r-1}s_r$$$. Here the numeration starts from $$$1$$$.If there are multiple sequences of operations with the smallest length which transform the sequence into a balanced one, you can output any of them.ExampleInput
