A. Brick Walltime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA brick is a strip of size $$$1 \times k$$$, placed horizontally or vertically, where $$$k$$$ can be an arbitrary number that is at least $$$2$$$ ($$$k \ge 2$$$).A brick wall of size $$$n \times m$$$ is such a way to place several bricks inside a rectangle $$$n \times m$$$, that all bricks lie either horizontally or vertically in the cells, do not cross the border of the rectangle, and that each cell of the $$$n \times m$$$ rectangle belongs to exactly one brick. Here $$$n$$$ is the height of the rectangle $$$n \times m$$$ and $$$m$$$ is the width. Note that there can be bricks with different values of k in the same brick wall.The wall stability is the difference between the number of horizontal bricks and the number of vertical bricks. Note that if you used $$$0$$$ horizontal bricks and $$$2$$$ vertical ones, then the stability will be $$$-2$$$, not $$$2$$$.What is the maximal possible stability of a wall of size $$$n \times m$$$?It is guaranteed that under restrictions in the statement at least one $$$n \times m$$$ wall exists.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10\,000$$$), the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n,\,m \le 10^4$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer, the maximum stability of a wall of size $$$n \times m$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the 1st test case, the maximum stability of $$$2$$$ is obtained by placing two horizontal bricks $$$1 \times 2$$$ one on top of the other.In the 2nd test case, one can get the maximum stability of $$$28$$$ by placing $$$4$$$ horizontal bricks $$$1 \times 2$$$ in each of the $$$7$$$ rows.
