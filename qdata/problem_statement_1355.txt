E. Almost Perfecttime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is called almost perfect if for all integer $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, it holds that $$$\lvert p_i - p^{-1}_i \rvert \le 1$$$, where $$$p^{-1}$$$ is the inverse permutation of $$$p$$$ (i.e. $$$p^{-1}_{k_1} = k_2$$$ if and only if $$$p_{k_2} = k_1$$$).Count the number of almost perfect permutations of length $$$n$$$ modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of almost perfect permutations of length $$$n$$$ modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExampleInput

NoteFor $$$n = 2$$$, both permutations $$$[1, 2]$$$, and $$$[2, 1]$$$ are almost perfect.For $$$n = 3$$$, there are only $$$6$$$ permutations. Having a look at all of them gives us:  $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ is an almost perfect permutation.  $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$ is an almost perfect permutation.  $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$ is an almost perfect permutation.  $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$ is NOT an almost perfect permutation ($$$\lvert p_2 - p^{-1}_2 \rvert = \lvert 3 - 1 \rvert = 2$$$).  $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$ is NOT an almost perfect permutation ($$$\lvert p_2 - p^{-1}_2 \rvert = \lvert 1 - 3 \rvert = 2$$$).  $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$ is an almost perfect permutation. So we get $$$4$$$ almost perfect permutations.
