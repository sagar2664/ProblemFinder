C. Least Prefix Sumtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBaltic, a famous chess player who is also a mathematician, has an array $$$a_1,a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, and he can perform the following operation several (possibly $$$0$$$) times:  Choose some index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$);  multiply $$$a_i$$$ with $$$-1$$$, that is, set $$$a_i := -a_i$$$. Baltic's favorite number is $$$m$$$, and he wants $$$a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_m$$$ to be the smallest of all non-empty prefix sums. More formally, for each $$$k = 1,2,\ldots, n$$$ it should hold that $$$$$$a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k \geq a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_m.$$$$$$Please note that multiple smallest prefix sums may exist and that it is only required that $$$a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_m$$$ is one of them.Help Baltic find the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_m$$$ the least of all prefix sums. It can be shown that a valid sequence of operations always exists.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of Baltic's array and his favorite number.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of required operations.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first example, we perform the operation $$$a_4 := -a_4$$$. The array becomes $$$[-1,-2,-3,4]$$$ and the prefix sums, $$$[a_1, \ a_1+a_2, \ a_1+a_2+a_3, \ a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4]$$$, are equal to $$$[-1,-3,-6,-2]$$$. Thus $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3=-6$$$ is the smallest of all prefix sums.In the second example, we perform the operation $$$a_3 := -a_3$$$. The array becomes $$$[1,2,-3,4]$$$ with prefix sums equal to $$$[1,3,0,4]$$$.In the third and fourth examples, $$$a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_m$$$ is already the smallest of the prefix sums — no operation needs to be performed.In the fifth example, a valid sequence of operations is:  $$$a_3 := -a_3$$$,  $$$a_2 := -a_2$$$,  $$$a_5 := -a_5$$$. The array becomes $$$[-2,-3,5,-5,20]$$$ and its prefix sums are $$$[-2,-5,0,-5,15]$$$. Note that $$$a_1+a_2=-5$$$ and $$$a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4=-5$$$ are both the smallest of the prefix sums (and this is a valid solution).
