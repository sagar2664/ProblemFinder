A. Organizing SWERCtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGianni, SWERC's chief judge, received a huge amount of high quality problems from the judges and now he has to choose a problem set for SWERC.He received $$$n$$$ problems and he assigned a beauty score and a difficulty to each of them. The $$$i$$$-th problem has beauty score equal to $$$b_i$$$ and difficulty equal to $$$d_i$$$. The beauty and the difficulty are integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$10$$$. If there are no problems with a certain difficulty (the possible difficulties are $$$1,2,\dots,10$$$) then Gianni will ask for more problems to the judges.Otherwise, for each difficulty between $$$1$$$ and $$$10$$$, he will put in the problem set one of the most beautiful problems with such difficulty (so the problem set will contain exactly $$$10$$$ problems with distinct difficulties). You shall compute the total beauty of the problem set, that is the sum of the beauty scores of the problems chosen by Gianni.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 100$$$) — how many problems Gianni received from the judges.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers each. The $$$i$$$-th of such lines contains $$$b_i$$$ and $$$d_i$$$ ($$$1\le b_i, d_i\le 10$$$) — the beauty score and the difficulty of the $$$i$$$-th problem.OutputFor each test case, print the total beauty of the problem set chosen by Gianni. If Gianni cannot create a problem set (because there are no problems with a certain difficulty) print the string MOREPROBLEMS (all letters are uppercase, there are no spaces).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, Gianni has received only $$$3$$$ problems, with difficulties $$$3, 4, 7$$$ which are not sufficient to create a problem set (for example because there is not a problem with difficulty $$$1$$$).In the second test case, Gianni will create a problem set by taking the problems $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$7$$$, $$$8$$$, $$$9$$$, $$$10$$$, $$$11$$$ (which have beauty equal to $$$10$$$ and all difficulties from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$) and one of the problems $$$1$$$ and $$$6$$$ (which have both beauty $$$3$$$ and difficulty $$$10$$$). The total beauty of the resulting problem set is $$$10\cdot 9 + 3 = 93$$$.
