D. Unnatural Language Processingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLura was bored and decided to make a simple language using the five letters $$$\texttt{a}$$$, $$$\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\texttt{c}$$$, $$$\texttt{d}$$$, $$$\texttt{e}$$$. There are two types of letters:   vowels — the letters $$$\texttt{a}$$$ and $$$\texttt{e}$$$. They are represented by $$$\textsf{V}$$$.  consonants — the letters $$$\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\texttt{c}$$$, and $$$\texttt{d}$$$. They are represented by $$$\textsf{C}$$$.  There are two types of syllables in the language: $$$\textsf{CV}$$$ (consonant followed by vowel) or $$$\textsf{CVC}$$$ (vowel with consonant before and after). For example, $$$\texttt{ba}$$$, $$$\texttt{ced}$$$, $$$\texttt{bab}$$$ are syllables, but $$$\texttt{aa}$$$, $$$\texttt{eda}$$$, $$$\texttt{baba}$$$ are not.A word in the language is a sequence of syllables. Lura has written a word in the language, but she doesn't know how to split it into syllables. Help her break the word into syllables.For example, given the word $$$\texttt{bacedbab}$$$, it would be split into syllables as $$$\texttt{ba.ced.bab}$$$ (the dot $$$\texttt{.}$$$ represents a syllable boundary).InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the word.The second line of each test case contains a string consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin characters  — the word. All words given are valid words in the language; that is, they only use the letters $$$\texttt{a}$$$, $$$\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\texttt{c}$$$, $$$\texttt{d}$$$, $$$\texttt{e}$$$, and each word is made up of several syllables.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor test case, output a string denoting the word split into syllables by inserting a dot $$$\texttt{.}$$$ between every pair of adjacent syllables.If there are multiple possible splittings, output any of them. The input is given in such a way that at least one possible splitting exists.ExampleInput
