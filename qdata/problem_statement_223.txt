Each edge is labeled with some integer $$$w_i$$$.Define $$$len(u, v)$$$ as the number of edges in the simple path between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and $$$gcd(u, v)$$$ as the Greatest Common Divisor of all numbers written on the edges of the simple path between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. For example, $$$len(u, u) = 0$$$ and $$$gcd(u, u) = 0$$$ for any $$$1 \leq u \leq n$$$.You need to find the maximum value of $$$len(u, v) \cdot gcd(u, v)$$$ over all pairs of vertices in the tree.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by their description.The first line of each test case contains the number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines specify the edges in the format $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$, $$$1 \leq w \leq 10^{12}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single number equal to the maximum value of $$$len(u, v) \cdot gcd(u, v)$$$ over all pairs of vertices in the tree.ExampleInput
