A. Print a Pedestal (Codeforces logo?)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven the integer $$$n$$$ — the number of available blocks. You must use all blocks to build a pedestal. The pedestal consists of $$$3$$$ platforms for $$$2$$$-nd, $$$1$$$-st and $$$3$$$-rd places respectively. The platform for the $$$1$$$-st place must be strictly higher than for the $$$2$$$-nd place, and the platform for the $$$2$$$-nd place must be strictly higher than for the $$$3$$$-rd place. Also, the height of each platform must be greater than zero (that is, each platform must contain at least one block).  Example pedestal of $$$n=11$$$ blocks: second place height equals $$$4$$$ blocks, first place height equals $$$5$$$ blocks, third place height equals $$$2$$$ blocks.Among all possible pedestals of $$$n$$$ blocks, deduce one such that the platform height for the $$$1$$$-st place minimum as possible. If there are several of them, output any of them.InputThe first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$6 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the total number of blocks for the pedestal. All $$$n$$$ blocks must be used.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ values over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$3$$$ numbers $$$h_2, h_1, h_3$$$ — the platform heights for $$$2$$$-nd, $$$1$$$-st and $$$3$$$-rd places on a pedestal consisting of $$$n$$$ blocks ($$$h_1+h_2+h_3=n$$$, $$$0 < h_3 < h_2 < h_1$$$). Among all possible pedestals, output the one for which the value of $$$h_1$$$ minimal. If there are several of them, output any of them.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case we can not get the height of the platform for the first place less than $$$5$$$, because if the height of the platform for the first place is not more than $$$4$$$, then we can use at most $$$4 + 3 + 2 = 9$$$ blocks. And we should use $$$11 = 4 + 5 + 2$$$ blocks. Therefore, the answer 4 5 2 fits. In the second set, the only suitable answer is: 2 3 1.
