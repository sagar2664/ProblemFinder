For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m-1$$$, perform the following operations:   define $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ as the (unique) vertices in the weakly connected components$$$^\ddagger$$$ containing vertices $$$p_i$$$ and $$$p_i+1$$$ respectively with only incoming edges$$$^{\dagger\dagger}$$$;  in graph $$$G$$$, add a directed edge from vertex $$$v$$$ to $$$u$$$ if $$$a_{p_i}=0$$$, otherwise add a directed edge from vertex $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ (if $$$a_{p_i}=1$$$).  Note that after each step, it can be proven that each weakly connected component of $$$G$$$ has a unique vertex with only incoming edges.Then, the value of $$$p$$$ is the number of incoming edges of vertex $$$1$$$ of $$$G$$$.For each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$, find the sum of values of all $$$k!$$$ permutations of length $$$k$$$. Since this value can be big, you are only required to compute this value under modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.  Operations when $$$n=3$$$, $$$a=[0,1]$$$ and $$$p=[1,2]$$$ $$$^\dagger$$$ A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).$$$^\ddagger$$$ The weakly connected components of a directed graph is the same as the components of the undirected version of the graph. Formally, for directed graph $$$G$$$, define a graph $$$H$$$ where for all edges $$$a \to b$$$ in $$$G$$$, you add an undirected edge $$$a \leftrightarrow b$$$ in $$$H$$$. Then the weakly connected components of $$$G$$$ are the components of $$$H$$$.$$$^{\dagger\dagger}$$$ Note that a vertex that has no edges is considered to have only incoming edges.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$a_i$$$ is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n-1$$$ integers in a line, the $$$i$$$-th integer should represent the answer when $$$k=i$$$, under modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput

NoteConsider the first test case.When $$$k=1$$$, there is only $$$1$$$ permutation $$$p$$$.  When $$$p=[1]$$$, we will add a single edge from vertex $$$2$$$ to $$$1$$$. Vertex $$$1$$$ will have $$$1$$$ incoming edge. So the value of $$$[1]$$$ is $$$1$$$. Therefore when $$$k=1$$$, the answer is $$$1$$$.When $$$k=2$$$, there are $$$2$$$ permutations $$$p$$$.  When $$$p=[1,2]$$$, we will add an edge from vertex $$$2$$$ to $$$1$$$ and an edge from $$$3$$$ to $$$1$$$. Vertex $$$1$$$ will have $$$2$$$ incoming edges. So the value of $$$[1,2]$$$ is $$$2$$$.  When $$$p=[2,1]$$$, we will add an edge from vertex $$$3$$$ to $$$2$$$ and an edge from $$$2$$$ to $$$1$$$. Vertex $$$1$$$ will have $$$1$$$ incoming edge. So the value of $$$[2,1]$$$ is $$$1$$$. Therefore when $$$k=2$$$, the answer is $$$2+1=3$$$.
