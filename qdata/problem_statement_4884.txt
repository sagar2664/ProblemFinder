I. Say Hellotime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTwo friends are travelling through Bubble galaxy. They say "Hello!" via signals to each other if their distance is smaller or equal than $$$d_1$$$ and   it's the first time they speak to each other or   at some point in time after their last talk their distance was greater than $$$d_2$$$. We need to calculate how many times friends said "Hello!" to each other. For $$$N$$$ moments, you'll have an array of points for each friend representing their positions at that moment. A person can stay in the same position between two moments in time, but if a person made a move we assume this movement as movement with constant speed in constant direction.InputThe first line contains one integer number $$$N$$$ ($$$2 \leq N \leq 100\,000$$$) representing number of moments in which we captured positions for two friends.The second line contains two integer numbers $$$d_1$$$ and $$$d_2 \ (0 < d_1 < d_2 < 1000)$$$. The next $$$N$$$ lines contains four integer numbers $$$A_x,A_y,B_x,B_y$$$ ($$$0 \leq A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y \leq 1000$$$) representing coordinates of friends A and B in each captured moment.OutputOutput contains one integer number that represents how many times friends will say "Hello!" to each other.ExampleInput42 50 0 0 105 5 5 65 0 10 514 7 10 5Output2Note Explanation: Friends should send signals 2 times to each other, first time around point $$$A2$$$ and $$$B2$$$ and second time during A's travel from point $$$A3$$$ to $$$A4$$$ while B stays in point $$$B3=B4$$$.
