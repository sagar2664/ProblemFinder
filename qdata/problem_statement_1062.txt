H. Maximum Permutationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEcrade bought a deck of cards numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Let the value of a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ be $$$\min\limits_{i = 1}^{n - k + 1}\ \sum\limits_{j = i}^{i + k - 1}a_j$$$.Ecrade wants to find the most valuable one among all permutations of the cards. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him! InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$4 \leq k < n \leq 10^5$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the largest possible value in the first line. Then in the second line, print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$, all $$$a_i$$$ are distinct)  — the elements of the permutation that has the largest value.If there are multiple such permutations, output any of them.ExampleInput

It can be shown that no permutations of length $$$5$$$ have a value greater than $$$13$$$ when $$$k = 4$$$.In the second test case, $$$[4,2,5,7,8,3,1,6]$$$ has a value of $$$18$$$. It can be shown that no permutations of length $$$8$$$ have a value greater than $$$18$$$ when $$$k = 4$$$.
