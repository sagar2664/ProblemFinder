For example, two different strings, which differ from each other by a cyclical shift, are still considered different cyclical strings.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 40$$$) — the length of the target string $$$t$$$.The next line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le n$$$) — the string which must be a substring of cyclical string $$$t$$$. String $$$s$$$ contains only characters '0' and '1'.OutputPrint the only integer — the number of distinct cyclical binary strings $$$t$$$, which contain $$$s$$$ as a substring.ExamplesInput20Output3Input41010Output2Input2010101010101010Output962NoteIn the first example, there are three cyclical strings, which contain "0" — "00", "01" and "10".In the second example, there are only two such strings — "1010", "0101".
