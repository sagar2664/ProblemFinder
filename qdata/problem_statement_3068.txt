E. Deleting Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem.There is an unknown integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1\le x\le n$$$). You want to find $$$x$$$.At first, you have a set of integers $$$\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$$$. You can perform the following operations no more than $$$10000$$$ times:  A $$$a$$$: find how many numbers are multiples of $$$a$$$ in the current set.  B $$$a$$$: find how many numbers are multiples of $$$a$$$ in this set, and then delete all multiples of $$$a$$$, but $$$x$$$ will never be deleted (even if it is a multiple of $$$a$$$). In this operation, $$$a$$$ must be greater than $$$1$$$.  C $$$a$$$: it means that you know that $$$x=a$$$. This operation can be only performed once. Remember that in the operation of type B $$$a>1$$$ must hold.Write a program, that will find the value of $$$x$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 10^5$$$). The remaining parts of the input will be given throughout the interaction process.InteractionIn each round, your program needs to print a line containing one uppercase letter A, B or C and an integer $$$a$$$ ($$$1\le a\le n$$$ for operations A and C, $$$2\le a\le n$$$ for operation B). This line desribes operation you make.If your operation has type C your program should terminate immediately.Else your program should read one line containing a single integer, which is the answer to your operation.After outputting each line, don't forget to flush the output. To do it use:  fflush(stdout) in C/C++;  System.out.flush() in Java;  sys.stdout.flush() in Python;  flush(output) in Pascal;  See the documentation for other languages. It is guaranteed, that the number $$$x$$$ is fixed and won't change during the interaction process.Hacks:To make a hack, use such input format:The only line should contain two integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq x \leq n \leq 10^5$$$).ExampleInput

NoteNote that to make the sample more clear, we added extra empty lines. You shouldn't print any extra empty lines during the interaction process.In the first test $$$n=10$$$ and $$$x=4$$$.Initially the set is: $$$\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$$$.In the first operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $$$4$$$ and delete them. The answer is $$$2$$$ because there are two numbers divisible by $$$4$$$: $$$\{4,8\}$$$. $$$8$$$ will be deleted but $$$4$$$ won't, because the number $$$x$$$ will never be deleted. Now the set is $$$\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10\}$$$.In the second operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $$$2$$$. The answer is $$$4$$$ because there are four numbers divisible by $$$2$$$: $$$\{2,4,6,10\}$$$.In the third operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of $$$8$$$. The answer is $$$0$$$ because there isn't any number divisible by $$$8$$$ in the current set.In the fourth operation, you know that $$$x=4$$$, which is the right answer.
