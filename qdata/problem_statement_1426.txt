A. Everyone Loves to Sleeptime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVlad, like everyone else, loves to sleep very much.Every day Vlad has to do $$$n$$$ things, each at a certain time. For each of these things, he has an alarm clock set, the $$$i$$$-th of them is triggered on $$$h_i$$$ hours $$$m_i$$$ minutes every day ($$$0 \le h_i < 24, 0 \le m_i < 60$$$). Vlad uses the $$$24$$$-hour time format, so after $$$h=12, m=59$$$ comes $$$h=13, m=0$$$ and after $$$h=23, m=59$$$ comes $$$h=0, m=0$$$.This time Vlad went to bed at $$$H$$$ hours $$$M$$$ minutes ($$$0 \le H < 24, 0 \le M < 60$$$) and asks you to answer: how much he will be able to sleep until the next alarm clock.If any alarm clock rings at the time when he went to bed, then he will sleep for a period of time of length $$$0$$$.InputThe first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.The first line of the case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$H$$$ and $$$M$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10, 0 \le H < 24, 0 \le M < 60$$$) — the number of alarms and the time Vlad went to bed.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain two numbers each $$$h_i$$$ and $$$m_i$$$ ($$$0 \le h_i < 24, 0 \le m_i < 60$$$) — the time of the $$$i$$$ alarm. It is acceptable that two or more alarms will trigger at the same time.Numbers describing time do not contain leading zeros.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each containing the answer to the corresponding test case. As an answer, output two numbers  — the number of hours and minutes that Vlad will sleep, respectively. If any alarm clock rings at the time when he went to bed, the answer will be 0 0.ExampleInput
