G. Balls and Pocketstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a strip with an infinite number of cells. Cells are numbered starting with $$$0$$$. Initially the cell $$$i$$$ contains a ball with the number $$$i$$$.There are $$$n$$$ pockets located at cells $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$. Each cell contains at most one pocket.Filtering is the following sequence of operations: All pockets at cells $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ open simultaneously, which makes balls currently located at those cells disappear. After the balls disappear, the pockets close again. For each cell $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$\infty$$$, if the cell $$$i$$$ contains a ball, we move that ball to the free cell $$$j$$$ with the lowest number. If there is no free cell $$$j < i$$$, the ball stays at the cell $$$i$$$.Note that after each filtering operation each cell will still contain exactly one ball.For example, let the cells $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ contain pockets. The initial configuration of balls is shown below (underscores display the cells with pockets): 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... After opening and closing the pockets, balls 1, 3 and 4 disappear: 0   2     5 6 7 8 9 ... After moving all the balls to the left, the configuration looks like this: 0 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ... Another filtering repetition results in the following: 0 5 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ... You have to answer $$$m$$$ questions. The $$$i$$$-th of these questions is "what is the number of the ball located at the cell $$$x_i$$$ after $$$k_i$$$ repetitions of the filtering operation?"InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ — the number of pockets and questions respectively ($$$1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5$$$).The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ — the numbers of cells containing pockets ($$$0 \leq a_1 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^9$$$).The following $$$m$$$ lines describe questions. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$k_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq x_i, k_i \leq 10^9$$$).OutputPrint $$$m$$$ numbers — answers to the questions, in the same order as given in the input.ExampleInput3 151 3 40 01 02 03 04 00 11 12 13 14 10 21 22 23 24 2Output0123402567058910
