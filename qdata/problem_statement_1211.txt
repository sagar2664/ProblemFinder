A. Indirect Sorttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once.You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero):  Choose any three indices $$$i, j, k$$$ ($$$1 \le i < j < k \le n$$$).  If $$$a_i > a_k$$$, replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_i + a_j$$$. Otherwise, swap $$$a_j$$$ and $$$a_k$$$. Determine whether you can make the array $$$a$$$ sorted in non-descending order.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$, $$$a_i \neq a_j$$$ if $$$i \neq j$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if the array can be sorted in non-descending order, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "YES", "yEs" and "yes" will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$[1,2,3]$$$ is already sorted in non-descending order.In the second test case, we can choose $$$i = 1,j = 2,k = 3$$$. Since $$$a_1 \le a_3$$$, swap $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$, the array then becomes $$$[1,2,3]$$$, which is sorted in non-descending order.In the seventh test case, we can do the following operations successively:  Choose $$$i = 5,j = 6,k = 7$$$. Since $$$a_5 \le a_7$$$, swap $$$a_6$$$ and $$$a_7$$$, the array then becomes $$$[1,2,6,7,4,5,3]$$$.  Choose $$$i = 5,j = 6,k = 7$$$. Since $$$a_5 > a_7$$$, replace $$$a_5$$$ with $$$a_5+a_6=9$$$, the array then becomes $$$[1,2,6,7,9,5,3]$$$.  Choose $$$i = 2,j = 5,k = 7$$$. Since $$$a_2 \le a_7$$$, swap $$$a_5$$$ and $$$a_7$$$, the array then becomes $$$[1,2,6,7,3,5,9]$$$.  Choose $$$i = 2,j = 4,k = 6$$$. Since $$$a_2 \le a_6$$$, swap $$$a_4$$$ and $$$a_6$$$, the array then becomes $$$[1,2,6,5,3,7,9]$$$.  Choose $$$i = 1,j = 3,k = 5$$$. Since $$$a_1 \le a_5$$$, swap $$$a_3$$$ and $$$a_5$$$, the array then becomes $$$[1,2,3,5,6,7,9]$$$, which is sorted in non-descending order. In the third, the fourth, the fifth and the sixth test cases, it can be shown that the array cannot be sorted in non-descending order.
