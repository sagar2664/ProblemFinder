B. I love AAABtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a string good if its length is at least $$$2$$$ and all of its characters are $$$\texttt{A}$$$ except for the last character which is $$$\texttt{B}$$$. The good strings are $$$\texttt{AB},\texttt{AAB},\texttt{AAAB},\ldots$$$. Note that $$$\texttt{B}$$$ is not a good string.You are given an initially empty string $$$s_1$$$.You can perform the following operation any number of times:   Choose any position of $$$s_1$$$ and insert some good string in that position. Given a string $$$s_2$$$, can we turn $$$s_1$$$ into $$$s_2$$$ after some number of operations?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single string $$$s_2$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s_2| \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$s_2$$$ consists of only the characters $$$\texttt{A}$$$ and $$$\texttt{B}$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s_2|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if we can turn $$$s_1$$$ into $$$s_2$$$ after some number of operations, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, we transform $$$s_1$$$ as such: $$$\varnothing \to \color{red}{\texttt{AAB}} \to \texttt{A}\color{red}{\texttt{AB}}\texttt{AB}$$$.In the third test case, we transform $$$s_1$$$ as such: $$$\varnothing \to \color{red}{\texttt{AAAAAAAAB}}$$$.In the second and fourth test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to turn $$$s_1$$$ into $$$s_2$$$.
