C. Travel Plantime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDuring the summer vacation after Zhongkao examination, Tom and Daniel are planning to go traveling.There are $$$n$$$ cities in their country, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. And the traffic system in the country is very special. For each city $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$), there is  a road between city $$$i$$$ and $$$2i$$$, if $$$2i\le n$$$;  a road between city $$$i$$$ and $$$2i+1$$$, if $$$2i+1\le n$$$. Making a travel plan, Daniel chooses some integer value between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$ for each city, for the $$$i$$$-th city we denote it by $$$a_i$$$.Let $$$s_{i,j}$$$ be the maximum value of cities in the simple$$$^\dagger$$$ path between cities $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$. The score of the travel plan is $$$\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=i}^n s_{i,j}$$$. Tom wants to know the sum of scores of all possible travel plans. Daniel asks you to help him find it. You just need to tell him the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.$$$^\dagger$$$ A simple path between cities $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ is a path between them that passes through each city at most once.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 200$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\leq n\leq 10^{18}$$$, $$$1\leq m\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of the cities and the maximum value of a city.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output one integer — the sum of scores of all possible travel plans, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, there is only one possible travel plan:  Path $$$1\rightarrow 1$$$: $$$s_{1,1}=a_1=1$$$.Path $$$1\rightarrow 2$$$: $$$s_{1,2}=\max(1,1)=1$$$.Path $$$1\rightarrow 3$$$: $$$s_{1,3}=\max(1,1)=1$$$.Path $$$2\rightarrow 2$$$: $$$s_{2,2}=a_2=1$$$.Path $$$2\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 3$$$: $$$s_{2,3}=\max(1,1,1)=1$$$.Path $$$3\rightarrow 3$$$: $$$s_{3,3}=a_3=1$$$.The score is $$$1+1+1+1+1+1=6$$$.In the second test case, there are four possible travel plans:  Score of plan $$$1$$$: $$$1+1+1=3$$$.Score of plan $$$2$$$: $$$1+2+2=5$$$.Score of plan $$$3$$$: $$$2+2+1=5$$$.Score of plan $$$4$$$: $$$2+2+2=6$$$.Therefore, the sum of score is $$$3+5+5+6=19$$$.
