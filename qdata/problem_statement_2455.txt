($$$k$$$) = $$$0$$$  where & denotes the bitwise AND operation.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the required integer $$$k$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase, the maximum value for which the continuous & operation gives 0 value, is 1.In the second testcase, the maximum value for which the continuous & operation gives 0 value, is 3. No value greater then 3, say for example 4, will give the & sum 0.   $$$5 \, \& \, 4 \neq 0$$$,  $$$5 \, \& \, 4 \, \& \, 3 = 0$$$. Hence, 3 is the answer.
