A. k-th equalitytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider all equalities of form $$$a + b = c$$$, where $$$a$$$ has $$$A$$$ digits, $$$b$$$ has $$$B$$$ digits, and $$$c$$$ has $$$C$$$ digits. All the numbers are positive integers and are written without leading zeroes. Find the $$$k$$$-th lexicographically smallest equality when written as a string like above or determine that it does not exist.For example, the first three equalities satisfying $$$A = 1$$$, $$$B = 1$$$, $$$C = 2$$$ are   $$$1 + 9 = 10$$$,  $$$2 + 8 = 10$$$,  $$$2 + 9 = 11$$$. An equality $$$s$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an equality $$$t$$$ with the same lengths of the numbers if and only if the following holds:   in the first position where $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ differ, the equality $$$s$$$ has a smaller digit than the corresponding digit in $$$t$$$. InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains integers $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq A, B, C \leq 6$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}$$$).Each input file has at most $$$5$$$ test cases which do not satisfy $$$A, B, C \leq 3$$$.OutputFor each test case, if there are strictly less than $$$k$$$ valid equalities, output $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, output the $$$k$$$-th equality as a string of form $$$a + b = c$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the first $$$9$$$ solutions are: $$$\langle 1, 1, 2 \rangle, \langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle, \langle 1, 3, 4 \rangle, \langle 1, 4, 5 \rangle, \langle 1, 5, 6 \rangle, \langle 1, 6, 7 \rangle, \langle 1, 7, 8 \rangle, \langle 1, 8, 9 \rangle, \langle 2, 1, 3 \rangle$$$.Int the third test case, there are no solutions as the smallest possible values for $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are larger than the maximal possible value of $$$c$$$ — $$$10 + 10 = 20 > 9$$$.Please note that whitespaces in the output matter.
