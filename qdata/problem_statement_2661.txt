E. Palindromic Doublestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.A palindromic sequence is a sequence that is equal to the reverse of itself.You are given a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. Any integer value appears in $$$a$$$ no more than twice.What is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of sequence $$$a$$$?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Then the descriptions of $$$t$$$ testcases follow.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 250\,000$$$) — the number of elements in the sequence.The second line of each testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$).Any integer value appears in $$$a$$$ no more than twice. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$250\,000$$$.OutputFor each testcase print a single integer — the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of sequence $$$a$$$.ExampleInput
