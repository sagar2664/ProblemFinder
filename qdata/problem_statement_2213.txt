Each competition is held in multiple stages; the regulations of the $$$i$$$-th competition state that this competition should consist of exactly $$$k_i$$$ stages, and each stage, starting from the second one, should be scheduled exactly $$$t_i$$$ days after the previous stage. In other words, if the first stage of the $$$i$$$-th competition is scheduled on day $$$x$$$, the second stage should be scheduled on day $$$x+t_i$$$, the third stage — on day $$$x+2t_i$$$, ..., the $$$k_i$$$-th stage (which is the last one) — on day $$$x+(k_i-1)t_i$$$.All $$$n$$$ competitions should be scheduled in such a way that they start and finish during the next $$$m$$$ days, and on any of these $$$m$$$ days, at most one stage of one competition is held (two stages of different competitions should not be scheduled on the same day).Is it possible to schedule all $$$n$$$ competitions to meet these constraints?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 5000$$$) — the number of competitions and the number of days, respectively.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, each describing a competition which should be scheduled. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$k_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$ ($$$2 \le k_i \le 5000$$$; $$$1 \le t_i \le 2$$$) — the parameters of the $$$i$$$-th competition.OutputIf it is impossible to schedule all $$$n$$$ competitions on the next $$$m$$$ days so that there is at most one stage during each day, print -1.Otherwise, print $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should represent the day when the first stage of the $$$i$$$-th competition is scheduled; days are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExamplesInput
