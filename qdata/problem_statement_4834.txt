A. Coinstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have unlimited number of coins with values $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$. You want to select some set of coins having the total value of $$$S$$$. It is allowed to have multiple coins with the same value in the set. What is the minimum number of coins required to get sum $$$S$$$?InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$S$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100\,000$$$, $$$1 \le S \le 10^9$$$)OutputPrint exactly one integer — the minimum number of coins required to obtain sum $$$S$$$.ExamplesInput5 11Output3Input6 16Output3NoteIn the first example, some of the possible ways to get sum $$$11$$$ with $$$3$$$ coins are:   $$$(3, 4, 4)$$$ $$$(2, 4, 5)$$$ $$$(1, 5, 5)$$$ $$$(3, 3, 5)$$$ It is impossible to get sum $$$11$$$ with less than $$$3$$$ coins.In the second example, some of the possible ways to get sum $$$16$$$ with $$$3$$$ coins are:   $$$(5, 5, 6)$$$ $$$(4, 6, 6)$$$ It is impossible to get sum $$$16$$$ with less than $$$3$$$ coins.
