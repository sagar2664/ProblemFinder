For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation (as $$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[0,1,2]$$$ is also not a permutation (as $$$n=3$$$, but $$$3$$$ is not present in the array).Your task is to construct a $$$k$$$-level permutation of length $$$n$$$.A permutation is called $$$k$$$-level if, among all the sums of continuous segments of length $$$k$$$ (of which there are exactly $$$n - k + 1$$$), any two sums differ by no more than $$$1$$$.More formally, to determine if the permutation $$$p$$$ is $$$k$$$-level, first construct an array $$$s$$$ of length $$$n - k + 1$$$, where $$$s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j$$$, i.e., the $$$i$$$-th element is equal to the sum of $$$p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1}$$$.A permutation is called $$$k$$$-level if $$$\max(s) - \min(s) \le 1$$$.Find any $$$k$$$-level permutation of length $$$n$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$k$$$ is even), where $$$n$$$ is the length of the desired permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output any $$$k$$$-level permutation of length $$$n$$$.It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.ExampleInput

NoteIn the second test case of the example:   $$$p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4$$$;  $$$p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3$$$.  The maximum among the sums is $$$4$$$, and the minimum is $$$3$$$.
