A5. Distinguish Rz(θ) from Ry(θ)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an angle $$$\theta$$$ (in radians, $$$0.01\pi \le \theta \le 0.99 \pi$$$) and an operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation: either the $$$Rz(\theta)$$$ gate or the $$$Ry(\theta)$$$ gate. The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which unitary it was and to return 0 if it was the $$$Rz(\theta)$$$ gate or 1 if it was the $$$Ry(\theta)$$$ gate. You are allowed to apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variants as many times as you need (within the time limit).You have to implement an operation which takes a floating-point number and a single-qubit operation as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;    operation Solve (theta : Double, unitary : (Qubit => Unit is Adj+Ctl)) : Int {        // your code here    }}
