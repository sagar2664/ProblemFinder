B. Luntik and Subsequencestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLuntik came out for a morning stroll and found an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. He calculated the sum $$$s$$$ of the elements of the array ($$$s= \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i$$$). Luntik calls a subsequence of the array $$$a$$$ nearly full if the sum of the numbers in that subsequence is equal to $$$s-1$$$.Luntik really wants to know the number of nearly full subsequences of the array $$$a$$$. But he needs to come home so he asks you to solve that problem!A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The next $$$2 \cdot t$$$ lines contain descriptions of test cases. The description of each test case consists of two lines.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 60$$$) — the length of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case print the number of nearly full subsequences of the array.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$s=1+2+3+4+5=15$$$, only $$$(2,3,4,5)$$$ is a nearly full subsequence among all subsequences, the sum in it is equal to $$$2+3+4+5=14=15-1$$$.In the second test case, there are no nearly full subsequences.In the third test case, $$$s=1+0=1$$$, the nearly full subsequences are $$$(0)$$$ and $$$()$$$ (the sum of an empty subsequence is $$$0$$$).
