B. Binary Pathtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a $$$2 \times n$$$ grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at the intersection of the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column be $$$a_{ij}$$$.There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ that can only jump one cell right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell $$$(2, n)$$$. Consider the binary string of length $$$n+1$$$ consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order.Your goal is to:   Find the lexicographically smallest$$$^\dagger$$$ string you can attain by choosing any available path;  Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. $$$^\dagger$$$ If two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ have the same length, then $$$s$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$t$$$ if and only if in the first position where $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ differ, the string $$$s$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$t$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$a_{11} a_{12} \ldots a_{1n}$$$ ($$$a_{1i}$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$).The third line of each test case contains a binary string $$$a_{21} a_{22} \ldots a_{2n}$$$ ($$$a_{2i}$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output two lines:   The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path;  The number of paths that yield this string.

NoteIn the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is $$$\mathtt{000}$$$. There are two paths that yield this string:  In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is $$$\mathtt{11000}$$$. There is only one path that yields this string:
