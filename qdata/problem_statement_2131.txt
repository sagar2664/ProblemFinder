E. Game with Stonestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputBob decided to take a break from calculus homework and designed a game for himself. The game is played on a sequence of piles of stones, which can be described with a sequence of integers $$$s_1, \ldots, s_k$$$, where $$$s_i$$$ is the number of stones in the $$$i$$$-th pile. On each turn, Bob picks a pair of non-empty adjacent piles $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ and takes one stone from each. If a pile becomes empty, its adjacent piles do not become adjacent. The game ends when Bob can't make turns anymore. Bob considers himself a winner if at the end all piles are empty.We consider a sequence of piles winning if Bob can start with it and win with some sequence of moves.You are given a sequence $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$, count the number of subsegments of $$$a$$$ that describe a winning sequence of piles. In other words find the number of segments $$$[l, r]$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$), such that the sequence $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$ is winning.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint a single integer for each test case — the answer to the problem.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, Bob can't win on subsegments of length $$$1$$$, as there is no pair of adjacent piles in an array of length $$$1$$$.In the second test case, every subsegment is not winning.In the fourth test case, the subsegment $$$[1, 4]$$$ is winning, because Bob can make moves with pairs of adjacent piles: $$$(2, 3)$$$, $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(3, 4)$$$. Another winning subsegment is $$$[2, 3]$$$.
