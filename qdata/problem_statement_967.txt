B. Taisia and Dicetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTaisia has $$$n$$$ six-sided dice. Each face of the die is marked with a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$6$$$, each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$6$$$ is used once.Taisia rolls all $$$n$$$ dice at the same time and gets a sequence of values $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 6$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the value on the upper face of the $$$i$$$-th dice. The sum of this sequence is equal to $$$s$$$.Suddenly, Taisia's pet cat steals exactly one dice with maximum value $$$a_i$$$ and calculates the sum of the values on the remaining $$$n-1$$$ dice, which is equal to $$$r$$$.You only know the number of dice $$$n$$$ and the values of $$$s$$$, $$$r$$$. Restore a possible sequence $$$a$$$ that fulfills the constraints.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Each testcase is given on a separate line and contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 50$$$, $$$1 \le r < s \le 300$$$).It is guaranteed that a solution exists.OutputFor each testcase, print: $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ in any order. It is guaranteed that such sequence exists.If there are multiple solutions, print any.ExampleInput
