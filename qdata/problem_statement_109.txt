E. Turtle vs. Rabbit Race: Optimal Trainingstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIsaac begins his training. There are $$$n$$$ running tracks available, and the $$$i$$$-th track ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) consists of $$$a_i$$$ equal-length sections. Given an integer $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \le u \le 10^9$$$), finishing each section can increase Isaac's ability by a certain value, described as follows:   Finishing the $$$1$$$-st section increases Isaac's performance by $$$u$$$.  Finishing the $$$2$$$-nd section increases Isaac's performance by $$$u-1$$$.  Finishing the $$$3$$$-rd section increases Isaac's performance by $$$u-2$$$.  $$$\ldots$$$  Finishing the $$$k$$$-th section ($$$k \ge 1$$$) increases Isaac's performance by $$$u+1-k$$$. (The value $$$u+1-k$$$ can be negative, which means finishing an extra section decreases Isaac's performance.)  You are also given an integer $$$l$$$. You must choose an integer $$$r$$$ such that $$$l \le r \le n$$$ and Isaac will finish each section of each track $$$l, l + 1, \dots, r$$$ (that is, a total of $$$\sum_{i=l}^r a_i = a_l + a_{l+1} + \ldots + a_r$$$ sections).Answer the following question: what is the optimal $$$r$$$ you can choose that the increase in Isaac's performance is maximum possible? If there are multiple $$$r$$$ that maximize the increase in Isaac's performance, output the smallest $$$r$$$.To increase the difficulty, you need to answer the question for $$$q$$$ different values of $$$l$$$ and $$$u$$$.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^4$$$).The third line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 10^5$$$).The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le n, 1 \le u \le 10^9$$$) — the descriptions to each query.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. The sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$q$$$ integers: the $$$i$$$-th integer contains the optimal $$$r$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th query. If there are multiple solutions, output the smallest one.ExampleInput

NoteFor the $$$1$$$-st query in the first test case:  By choosing $$$r = 3$$$, Isaac finishes $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8$$$ sections in total, hence his increase in performance is $$$u+(u-1)+\ldots+(u-7)=8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 36$$$.  By choosing $$$r = 4$$$, Isaac finishes $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9$$$ sections in total, hence his increase in performance is $$$u+(u-1)+\ldots+(u-8)=8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1+0 = 36$$$. Both choices yield the optimal increase in performance, however we want to choose the smallest $$$r$$$. So we choose $$$r = 3$$$.For the $$$2$$$-nd query in the first test case, by choosing $$$r = 4$$$, Isaac finishes $$$a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6$$$ sections in total, hence his increase in performance is $$$u+(u-1)+\ldots+(u-5)=7+6+5+4+3+2 = 27$$$. This is the optimal increase in performance.For the $$$3$$$-rd query in the first test case:  By choosing $$$r = 5$$$, Isaac finishes $$$a_5 = 5$$$ sections in total, hence his increase in performance is $$$u+(u-1)+\ldots+(u-4)=9+8+7+6+5 = 35$$$.  By choosing $$$r = 6$$$, Isaac finishes $$$a_5 + a_6 = 5 + 9 = 14$$$ sections in total, hence his increase in performance is $$$u+(u-1)+\ldots+(u-13)=9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1+0+(-1)+(-2)+(-3)+(-4) = 35$$$. Both choices yield the optimal increase in performance, however we want to choose the smallest $$$r$$$. So we choose $$$r = 5$$$.Hence the output for the first test case is $$$[3, 4, 5]$$$.
