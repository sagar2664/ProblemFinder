A. Anti Light's Cell Guessingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are playing a game on a $$$n \times m$$$ grid, in which the computer has selected some cell $$$(x, y)$$$ of the grid, and you have to determine which one. To do so, you will choose some $$$k$$$ and some $$$k$$$ cells $$$(x_1, y_1),\, (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_k, y_k)$$$, and give them to the computer. In response, you will get $$$k$$$ numbers $$$b_1,\, b_2, \ldots b_k$$$, where $$$b_i$$$ is the manhattan distance from $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$ to the hidden cell $$$(x, y)$$$ (so you know which distance corresponds to which of $$$k$$$ input cells). After receiving these $$$b_1,\, b_2, \ldots, b_k$$$, you have to be able to determine the hidden cell. What is the smallest $$$k$$$ for which is it possible to always guess the hidden cell correctly, no matter what cell computer chooses?As a reminder, the manhattan distance between cells $$$(a_1, b_1)$$$ and $$$(a_2, b_2)$$$ is equal to $$$|a_1-a_2|+|b_1-b_2|$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The single line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 10^9$$$) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the minimum $$$k$$$ for that test case.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the smallest such $$$k$$$ is $$$2$$$, for which you can choose, for example, cells $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(2, 1)$$$.Note that you can't choose cells $$$(1, 1)$$$ and $$$(2, 3)$$$ for $$$k = 2$$$, as both cells $$$(1, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 1)$$$ would give $$$b_1 = 1, b_2 = 2$$$, so we wouldn't be able to determine which cell is hidden if computer selects one of those.In the second test case, you should choose $$$k = 1$$$, for it you can choose cell $$$(3, 1)$$$ or $$$(1, 1)$$$.
