D. Tree XORtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. An integer $$$a_{i}$$$ is written on vertex $$$i$$$ for $$$i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$$$. You want to make all $$$a_{i}$$$ equal by performing some (possibly, zero) spells.Suppose you root the tree at some vertex. On each spell, you can select any vertex $$$v$$$ and any non-negative integer $$$c$$$. Then for all vertices $$$i$$$ in the subtree$$$^{\dagger}$$$ of $$$v$$$, replace $$$a_{i}$$$ with $$$a_{i} \oplus c$$$. The cost of this spell is $$$s \cdot c$$$, where $$$s$$$ is the number of vertices in the subtree. Here $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.Let $$$m_r$$$ be the minimum possible total cost required to make all $$$a_i$$$ equal, if vertex $$$r$$$ is chosen as the root of the tree. Find $$$m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{n}$$$.$$$^{\dagger}$$$ Suppose vertex $$$r$$$ is chosen as the root of the tree. Then vertex $$$i$$$ belongs to the subtree of $$$v$$$ if the simple path from $$$i$$$ to $$$r$$$ contains $$$v$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^{4}$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i < 2^{20}$$$).Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$), denoting that there is an edge connecting two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n$$$ on a new line.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, to find $$$m_1$$$ we root the tree at vertex $$$1$$$.   In the first spell, choose $$$v=2$$$ and $$$c=1$$$. After performing the spell, $$$a$$$ will become $$$[3, 3, 0, 1]$$$. The cost of this spell is $$$3$$$.  In the second spell, choose $$$v=3$$$ and $$$c=3$$$. After performing the spell, $$$a$$$ will become $$$[3, 3, 3, 1]$$$. The cost of this spell is $$$3$$$.  In the third spell, choose $$$v=4$$$ and $$$c=2$$$. After performing the spell, $$$a$$$ will become $$$[3, 3, 3, 3]$$$. The cost of this spell is $$$2$$$. Now all the values in array $$$a$$$ are equal, and the total cost is $$$3 + 3 + 2 = 8$$$.The values $$$m_2$$$, $$$m_3$$$, $$$m_4$$$ can be found analogously.In the second test case, the goal is already achieved because there is only one vertex.
