D. Blocking Elementstime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. Your task is to block some elements of the array in order to minimize its cost. Suppose you block the elements with indices $$$1 \leq b_1 < b_2 < \ldots < b_m \leq n$$$. Then the cost of the array is calculated as the maximum of:   the sum of the blocked elements, i.e., $$$a_{b_1} + a_{b_2} + \ldots + a_{b_m}$$$.  the maximum sum of the segments into which the array is divided when the blocked elements are removed. That is, the maximum sum of the following ($$$m + 1$$$) subarrays: [$$$1, b_1 − 1$$$], [$$$b_1 + 1, b_2 − 1$$$], [$$$\ldots$$$], [$$$b_{m−1} + 1, b_m - 1$$$], [$$$b_m + 1, n$$$] (the sum of numbers in a subarray of the form [$$$x,x − 1$$$] is considered to be $$$0$$$). For example, if $$$n = 6$$$, the original array is [$$$1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 2$$$], and you block the elements at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$, then the cost of the array will be the maximum of the sum of the blocked elements ($$$4 + 3 = 7$$$) and the sums of the subarrays ($$$1$$$, $$$5 + 3 = 8$$$, $$$2$$$), which is $$$\max(7,1,8,2) = 8$$$. You need to output the minimum cost of the array after blocking.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 30\,000$$$) — the number of queries.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ elements $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single number — the minimum cost of blocking the array.ExampleInput

NoteThe first test case matches with the array from the statement. To obtain a cost of $$$7$$$, you need to block the elements at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$. In this case, the cost of the array is calculated as the maximum of:  the sum of the blocked elements, which is $$$a_2 + a_4 = 7$$$.  the maximum sum of the segments into which the array is divided when the blocked elements are removed, i.e., the maximum of $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_3$$$, $$$a_5 + a_6 = \max(1,5,5) = 5$$$. So the cost is $$$\max(7,5) = 7$$$. In the second test case, you can block the elements at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$.In the third test case, to obtain the answer $$$11$$$, you can block the elements at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$. There are other ways to get this answer, for example, blocking positions $$$4$$$ and $$$6$$$.
