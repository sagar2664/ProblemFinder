C. Johnny Solvingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputToday is tuesday, that means there is a dispute in JOHNNY SOLVING team again: they try to understand who is Johnny and who is Solving. That's why guys asked Umnik to help them. Umnik gave guys a connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices without loops and multiedges, such that a degree of any vertex is at least $$$3$$$, and also he gave a number $$$1 \leq k \leq n$$$. Because Johnny is not too smart, he promised to find a simple path with length at least $$$\frac{n}{k}$$$ in the graph. In reply, Solving promised to find $$$k$$$ simple by vertices cycles with representatives, such that:   Length of each cycle is at least $$$3$$$.  Length of each cycle is not divisible by $$$3$$$.  In each cycle must be a representative - vertex, which belongs only to this cycle among all printed cycles. You need to help guys resolve the dispute, for that you need to find a solution for Johnny: a simple path with length at least $$$\frac{n}{k}$$$ ($$$n$$$ is not necessarily divided by $$$k$$$), or solution for Solving: $$$k$$$ cycles that satisfy all the conditions above. If there is no any solution - print $$$-1$$$. InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2.5 \cdot 10^5, 1 \leq m \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$$$)Next $$$m$$$ lines describe edges of the graph in format $$$v$$$, $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \leq v, u \leq n$$$). It's guaranteed that $$$v \neq u$$$ and all $$$m$$$ pairs are distinct.It's guaranteed that a degree of each vertex is at least $$$3$$$.OutputPrint PATH in the first line, if you solve problem for Johnny. In the second line print the number of vertices in the path $$$c$$$ ($$$c \geq \frac{n}{k}$$$). And in the third line print vertices describing the path in route order.Print CYCLES in the first line, if you solve problem for Solving. In the following lines describe exactly $$$k$$$ cycles in the following format: in the first line print the size of the cycle $$$c$$$ ($$$c \geq 3$$$). In the second line print the cycle in route order. Also, the first vertex in the cycle must be a representative.Print $$$-1$$$ if there is no any solution. The total amount of printed numbers in the output must be at most $$$10^6$$$. It's guaranteed, that if exists any solution then there is a correct output satisfies this restriction.ExamplesInput
