However, you were extremely bored in class and got tired of doing nothing, so you came up with a game for yourself.You are given a string $$$s$$$ and an even integer $$$n$$$. There are two types of operations that you can apply to it:  Add the reversed string $$$s$$$ to the end of the string $$$s$$$ (for example, if $$$s = $$$ cpm, then after applying the operation $$$s = $$$ cpmmpc).  Reverse the current string $$$s$$$ (for example, if $$$s = $$$ cpm, then after applying the operation $$$s = $$$ mpc). It is required to determine the lexicographically smallest$$$^{\dagger}$$$ string that can be obtained after applying exactly $$$n$$$ operations. Note that you can apply operations of different types in any order, but you must apply exactly $$$n$$$ operations in total.$$$^{\dagger}$$$A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:   $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \ne b$$$;  in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$. InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single even integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of operations applied to the string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 100$$$), consisting of lowercase English letters, — the string to which the operations are applied.OutputFor each test case, output a single line — the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after applying exactly $$$n$$$ operations.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, you can apply the operation of the second type (i.e., reverse the string $$$s$$$) $$$4$$$ times. Then the string $$$s$$$ will remain equal to cpm.In the second test case, you can do the following:   Apply the operation of the second type, after which $$$s$$$ will become equal to birg.  Apply operation of the first type (i.e., add the reversed string $$$s$$$ to the end of the string $$$s$$$), after which $$$s$$$ will become equal to birggrib.
