E. Divisors and Tabletime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an $$$n \times n$$$ multiplication table and a positive integer $$$m = m_1 \cdot m_2$$$. A $$$n \times n$$$ multiplication table is a table with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where $$$a_{i, j} = i \cdot j$$$.For each divisor $$$d$$$ of $$$m$$$, check: does $$$d$$$ occur in the table at least once, and if it does, what is the minimum row that contains $$$d$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10$$$) — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m_1$$$ and $$$m_2$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$; $$$1 \le m_1, m_2 \le 10^9$$$) — the size of the multiplication table and the integer $$$m$$$ represented as $$$m_1 \cdot m_2$$$.OutputFor each test case, let $$$d_1, d_2, \dots, d_k$$$ be all divisors of $$$m$$$ sorted in the increasing order. And let $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$$$ be an array of answers, where $$$a_i$$$ is equal to the minimum row index where divisor $$$d_i$$$ occurs, or $$$0$$$, if there is no such row.Since array $$$a$$$ may be large, first, print an integer $$$s$$$ — the number of divisors of $$$m$$$ that are present in the $$$n \times n$$$ table. Next, print a single value $$$X = a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus \dots \oplus a_k$$$, where $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$m = 72 \cdot 1 = 72$$$ and has $$$12$$$ divisors $$$[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72]$$$. The $$$3 \times 3$$$ multiplication table looks like that:  123112322463369  For each divisor of $$$m$$$ that is present in the table, the position with minimum row index is marked. So the array of answers $$$a$$$ is equal to $$$[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$. There are only $$$6$$$ non-zero values, and xor of $$$a$$$ is equal to $$$2$$$.In the second test case, $$$m = 10 \cdot 15 = 150$$$ and has $$$12$$$ divisors $$$[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150]$$$. All divisors except $$$75$$$ and $$$150$$$ are present in the $$$10 \times 10$$$ table. Array $$$a$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 3, 5, 0, 0]$$$. There are $$$10$$$ non-zero values, and xor of $$$a$$$ is equal to $$$0$$$.In the third test case, $$$m = 1 \cdot 210 = 210$$$ and has $$$16$$$ divisors $$$[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210]$$$. The $$$6 \times 6$$$ table with marked divisors is shown below:  1234561123456224681012336912151844812162024551015202530661218243036  Array $$$a$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$. There are $$$8$$$ non-zero values, and xor of $$$a$$$ is equal to $$$5$$$.
