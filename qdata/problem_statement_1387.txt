D2. Xor-Subsequence (hard version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$a_i \le 10^9$$$.You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots a_{n - 1}$$$. Bryap wants to find the longest beautiful subsequence in the array.An array $$$b = [b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{m-1}]$$$, where $$$0 \le b_0 < b_1 < \ldots < b_{m - 1} < n$$$, is a subsequence of length $$$m$$$ of the array $$$a$$$.Subsequence $$$b = [b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{m-1}]$$$ of length $$$m$$$ is called beautiful, if the following condition holds:   For any $$$p$$$ ($$$0 \le p < m - 1$$$) holds: $$$a_{b_p} \oplus b_{p+1} < a_{b_{p+1}} \oplus b_p$$$. Here $$$a \oplus b$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. For example, $$$2 \oplus 4 = 6$$$ and $$$3 \oplus 1=2$$$.Bryap is a simple person so he only wants to know the length of the longest such subsequence. Help Bryap and find the answer to his question.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_0,a_1,...,a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the length of the longest beautiful subsequence.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, we can pick the whole array as a beautiful subsequence because $$$1 \oplus 1 < 2 \oplus 0$$$.In the second test case, we can pick elements with indexes $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$ (in $$$0$$$ indexation). For this elements holds: $$$2 \oplus 2 < 4 \oplus 1$$$ and $$$4 \oplus 4 < 1 \oplus 2$$$.
