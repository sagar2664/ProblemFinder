C. Watering an Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. On the $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$d$$$ days you are going to do exactly one of the following two actions:  Add $$$1$$$ to each of the first $$$b_i$$$ elements of the array $$$a$$$ (i.e., set $$$a_j := a_j + 1$$$ for each $$$1 \le j \le b_i$$$).  Count the elements which are equal to their position (i.e., the $$$a_j = j$$$). Denote the number of such elements as $$$c$$$. Then, you add $$$c$$$ to your score, and reset the entire array $$$a$$$ to a $$$0$$$-array of length $$$n$$$ (i.e., set $$$[a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] := [0, 0, \ldots, 0]$$$). Your score is equal to $$$0$$$ in the beginning. Note that on each day you should perform exactly one of the actions above: you cannot skip a day or perform both actions on the same day.What is the maximum score you can achieve at the end?Since $$$d$$$ can be quite large, the sequence $$$b$$$ is given to you in the compressed format:   You are given a sequence of integers $$$v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$$$. The sequence $$$b$$$ is a concatenation of infinitely many copies of $$$v$$$: $$$b = [v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k, \ldots]$$$. InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2000$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10^5$$$, $$$k \le d \le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$, the length of the sequence $$$v$$$ and the number of days you are going to perform operations on.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.The third line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$$$ ($$$1 \le v_i \le n$$$) — the sequence $$$v$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2000$$$ and the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output one integer: the maximum score you can achieve at the end of the $$$d$$$-th day.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the sequence $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$[1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, \ldots]$$$ and one of the optimal solutions for this case is as follows:  Perform the operation of the second type on the $$$1$$$-st day: your score increases by $$$3$$$ and array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[0, 0, 0]$$$.  Perform the operation of the first type on the $$$2$$$-nd day: array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[1, 1, 1]$$$.  Perform the operation of the first type on the $$$3$$$-rd day: array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[2, 2, 1]$$$.  Perform the operation of the second type on the $$$4$$$-th day: your score increases by $$$1$$$ and array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[0, 0, 0]$$$. It can be shown that it is impossible to score more than $$$4$$$, so the answer is $$$4$$$.In the second test case, the sequence $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$[6, 6, 6, 6, \ldots]$$$. One of the ways to score $$$3$$$ is to perform operations of the first type on the $$$1$$$-st and the $$$3$$$-rd days and to perform an operation of the second type on the $$$2$$$-nd day.
