C. Andrew and Stonestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAndrew has $$$n$$$ piles with stones. The $$$i$$$-th pile contains $$$a_i$$$ stones. He wants to make his table clean so he decided to put every stone either to the $$$1$$$-st or the $$$n$$$-th pile.Andrew can perform the following operation any number of times: choose $$$3$$$ indices $$$1 \le i < j < k \le n$$$, such that the $$$j$$$-th pile contains at least $$$2$$$ stones, then he takes $$$2$$$ stones from the pile $$$j$$$ and puts one stone into pile $$$i$$$ and one stone into pile $$$k$$$. Tell Andrew what is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the stones to piles $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, or determine if it's impossible.InputThe input contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10\,000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line for each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The second line contains a sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the array elements.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the minimum number of operations needed to move stones to piles $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, or print $$$-1$$$ if it's impossible.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, it is optimal to do the following:   Select $$$(i, j, k) = (1, 2, 5)$$$. The array becomes equal to $$$[2, 0, 2, 3, 7]$$$.  Select $$$(i, j, k) = (1, 3, 4)$$$. The array becomes equal to $$$[3, 0, 0, 4, 7]$$$.  Twice select $$$(i, j, k) = (1, 4, 5)$$$. The array becomes equal to $$$[5, 0, 0, 0, 9]$$$. This array satisfy the statement, because every stone is moved to piles $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$.  There are $$$4$$$ operations in total.In the second test case, it's impossible to put all stones into piles with numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$:   At the beginning there's only one possible operation with $$$(i, j, k) = (1, 2, 3)$$$. The array becomes equal to $$$[2, 1, 2]$$$.  Now there is no possible operation and the array doesn't satisfy the statement, so the answer is $$$-1$$$. In the third test case, it's optimal to do the following:   Select $$$(i, j, k) = (1, 2, 3)$$$. The array becomes equal to $$$[2, 0, 2]$$$. This array satisfies the statement, because every stone is moved to piles $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$.  The is $$$1$$$ operation in total.In the fourth test case, it's impossible to do any operation, and the array doesn't satisfy the statement, so the answer is $$$-1$$$.
