C. BA-Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$k$$$ and a string $$$s$$$ that consists only of characters 'a' (a lowercase Latin letter) and '*' (an asterisk).Each asterisk should be replaced with several (from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$ inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisk can be replaced with different counts of letter 'b'.The result of the replacement is called a BA-string.Two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are different if they either have different lengths or there exists such a position $$$i$$$ that $$$a_i \neq b_i$$$.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:   $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \ne b$$$;  in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$. Now consider all different BA-strings and find the $$$x$$$-th lexicographically smallest of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2000$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2000$$$; $$$0 \le k \le 2000$$$; $$$1 \le x \le 10^{18}$$$). $$$n$$$ is the length of string $$$s$$$.The second line of each testcase is a string $$$s$$$. It consists of $$$n$$$ characters, each of them is either 'a' (a lowercase Latin letter) or '*' (an asterisk).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2000$$$. For each testcase $$$x$$$ doesn't exceed the total number of different BA-strings. String $$$s$$$ contains at least one character 'a'.OutputFor each testcase, print a single string, consisting only of characters 'b' and 'a' (lowercase Latin letters) — the $$$x$$$-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase of the example, BA-strings ordered lexicographically are:   a  ab  abb  abbb  abbbb In the second testcase of the example, BA-strings ordered lexicographically are:   aa  aba  abba Note that string "aba" is only counted once, even though there are two ways to replace asterisks with characters 'b' to get it.
