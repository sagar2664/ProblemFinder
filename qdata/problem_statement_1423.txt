D. Color with Occurrencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given some text $$$t$$$ and a set of $$$n$$$ strings $$$s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$$$. In one step, you can choose any occurrence of any string $$$s_i$$$ in the text $$$t$$$ and color the corresponding characters of the text in red. For example, if $$$t=\texttt{bababa}$$$ and $$$s_1=\texttt{ba}$$$, $$$s_2=\texttt{aba}$$$, you can get $$$t=\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}\texttt{baba}$$$, $$$t=\texttt{b}\color{red}{\texttt{aba}}\texttt{ba}$$$ or $$$t=\texttt{bab}\color{red}{\texttt{aba}}$$$ in one step.You want to color all the letters of the text $$$t$$$ in red. When you color a letter in red again, it stays red.In the example above, three steps are enough:  Let's color $$$t[2 \dots 4]=s_2=\texttt{aba}$$$ in red, we get $$$t=\texttt{b}\color{red}{\texttt{aba}}\texttt{ba}$$$;  Let's color $$$t[1 \dots 2]=s_1=\texttt{ba}$$$ in red, we get $$$t=\color{red}{\texttt{baba}}\texttt{ba}$$$;  Let's color $$$t[4 \dots 6]=s_2=\texttt{aba}$$$ in red, we get $$$t=\color{red}{\texttt{bababa}}$$$. Each string $$$s_i$$$ can be applied any number of times (or not at all). Occurrences for coloring can intersect arbitrarily.Determine the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters $$$t$$$ in red and how to do it. If it is impossible to color all letters of the text $$$t$$$ in red, output -1.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 100$$$) —the number of test cases in the test.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains the text $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le |t| \le 100$$$), consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, where $$$|t|$$$ is the length of the text $$$t$$$.The second line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10$$$) — the number of strings in the set.This is followed by $$$n$$$ lines, each containing a string $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \le |s_i| \le 10$$$) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, where $$$|s_i|$$$ — the length of string $$$s_i$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the answer on a separate line.If it is impossible to color all the letters of the text in red, print a single line containing the number -1.Otherwise, on the first line, print the number $$$m$$$ — the minimum number of steps it will take to turn all the letters $$$t$$$ red.Then in the next $$$m$$$ lines print pairs of indices: $$$w_j$$$ and $$$p_j$$$ ($$$1 \le j \le m$$$), which denote that the string with index $$$w_j$$$ was used as a substring to cover the occurrences starting in the text $$$t$$$ from position $$$p_j$$$. The pairs can be output in any order.If there are several answers, output any of them.ExampleInput
