A. Marathontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given four distinct integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$. Timur and three other people are running a marathon. The value $$$a$$$ is the distance that Timur has run and $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ correspond to the distances the other three participants ran. Output the number of participants in front of Timur.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The description of each test case consists of four distinct integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, $$$d$$$ ($$$0 \leq a, b, c, d \leq 10^4$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of participants in front of Timur.ExampleInput

NoteFor the first test case, there are $$$2$$$ people in front of Timur, specifically the participants who ran distances of $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$. The other participant is not in front of Timur because he ran a shorter distance than Timur.For the second test case, no one is in front of Timur, since he ran a distance of $$$10000$$$ while all others ran a distance of $$$0$$$, $$$1$$$, and $$$2$$$ respectively.For the third test case, only the second person is in front of Timur, who ran a total distance of $$$600$$$ while Timur ran a distance of $$$500$$$.
