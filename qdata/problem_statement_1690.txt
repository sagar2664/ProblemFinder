NoteIn the first test case there is just a single element, so it can't occur at least three times and the answer is -1.In the second test case, all three elements of the array are equal to $$$2$$$, so $$$2$$$ occurs three times, and so the answer is $$$2$$$.For the third test case, $$$2$$$ occurs four times, so the answer is $$$2$$$.For the fourth test case, $$$4$$$ occurs three times, so the answer is $$$4$$$.For the fifth test case, $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ all occur at least three times, so they are all valid outputs.For the sixth test case, all elements are distinct, so none of them occurs at least three times and the answer is -1.
