C. Jatayu's Balanced Bracket Sequencetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLast summer, Feluda gifted Lalmohan-Babu a balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$ of length $$$2 n$$$.Topshe was bored during his summer vacations, and hence he decided to draw an undirected graph of $$$2 n$$$ vertices using the balanced bracket sequence $$$s$$$. For any two distinct vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i < j \le 2 n$$$), Topshe draws an edge (undirected and unweighted) between these two nodes if and only if the subsegment $$$s[i \ldots j]$$$ forms a balanced bracket sequence.Determine the number of connected components in Topshe's graph.See the Notes section for definitions of the underlined terms.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of opening brackets in string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$2 n$$$ — a balanced bracket sequence consisting of $$$n$$$ opening brackets "(", and $$$n$$$ closing brackets ")".It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of connected components in Topshe's graph.ExampleInput

NoteSample explanation:In the first test case, the graph constructed from the bracket sequence (), is just a graph containing nodes $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ connected by a single edge. In the second test case, the graph constructed from the bracket sequence ()(()) would be the following (containing two connected components):  Definition of Underlined Terms: A sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters $$$+$$$ and $$$1$$$. For example, sequences (())(), (), and (()(())) are balanced, while )(, ((), and (()))( are not. The subsegment $$$s[l \ldots r]$$$ denotes the sequence $$$[s_l, s_{l + 1}, \ldots, s_r]$$$. A connected component is a set of vertices $$$X$$$ such that for every two vertices from this set there exists at least one path in the graph connecting these vertices, but adding any other vertex to $$$X$$$ violates this rule.
