C. Increase Subarray Sumstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You are also given an integer value $$$x$$$.Let $$$f(k)$$$ be the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of $$$a$$$ after applying the following operation: add $$$x$$$ to the elements on exactly $$$k$$$ distinct positions. An empty subarray should also be considered, it has sum $$$0$$$.Note that the subarray doesn't have to include all of the increased elements.Calculate the maximum value of $$$f(k)$$$ for all $$$k$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$ independently.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of the testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5000$$$; $$$0 \le x \le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array and the value to add.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^5 \le a_i \le 10^5$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$5000$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print $$$n + 1$$$ integers — the maximum value of $$$f(k)$$$ for all $$$k$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$ independently.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase, it doesn't matter which elements you add $$$x$$$ to. The subarray with the maximum sum will always be the entire array. If you increase $$$k$$$ elements by $$$x$$$, $$$k \cdot x$$$ will be added to the sum.In the second testcase:   For $$$k = 0$$$, the empty subarray is the best option.  For $$$k = 1$$$, it's optimal to increase the element at position $$$3$$$. The best sum becomes $$$-1 + 5 = 4$$$ for a subarray $$$[3, 3]$$$.  For $$$k = 2$$$, it's optimal to increase the element at position $$$3$$$ and any other element. The best sum is still $$$4$$$ for a subarray $$$[3, 3]$$$.  For $$$k = 3$$$, you have to increase all elements. The best sum becomes $$$(-2 + 5) + (-7 + 5) + (-1 + 5) = 5$$$ for a subarray $$$[1, 3]$$$.
