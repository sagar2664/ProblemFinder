C. Double Lexicographically Minimumtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$. You can reorder the characters to form a string $$$t$$$. Define $$$t_{\mathrm{max}}$$$ to be the lexicographical maximum of $$$t$$$ and $$$t$$$ in reverse order.Given $$$s$$$ determine the lexicographically minimum value of $$$t_{\mathrm{max}}$$$ over all reorderings $$$t$$$ of $$$s$$$.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:   $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \ne b$$$;  in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$. InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow.The first and only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 10^5$$$). $$$s$$$ consists of only lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the lexicographically minimum value of $$$t_{\mathrm{max}}$$$ over all reorderings $$$t$$$ of $$$s$$$.

NoteFor the first test case, there is only one reordering of $$$s$$$, namely "a".For the second test case, there are three reorderings of $$$s$$$.  $$$t = \mathtt{aab}$$$: $$$t_{\mathrm{max}} = \max(\mathtt{aab}, \mathtt{baa}) = \mathtt{baa}$$$  $$$t = \mathtt{aba}$$$: $$$t_{\mathrm{max}} = \max(\mathtt{aba}, \mathtt{aba}) = \mathtt{aba}$$$  $$$t = \mathtt{baa}$$$: $$$t_{\mathrm{max}} = \max(\mathtt{baa}, \mathtt{aab}) = \mathtt{baa}$$$ The lexicographical minimum of $$$t_{\mathrm{max}}$$$ over all cases is "aba".
