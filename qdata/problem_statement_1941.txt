F. Strange Instructionstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDasha has $$$10^{100}$$$ coins. Recently, she found a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and some operations that allows to change this string (she can do each operation any number of times):  Replace substring 00 of $$$s$$$ by 0 and receive $$$a$$$ coins.  Replace substring 11 of $$$s$$$ by 1 and receive $$$b$$$ coins.  Remove 0 from any position in $$$s$$$ and pay $$$c$$$ coins. It turned out that while doing this operations Dasha should follow the rule:  It is forbidden to do two operations with the same parity in a row. Operations are numbered by integers $$$1$$$-$$$3$$$ in the order they are given above. Please, calculate what is the maximum profit Dasha can get by doing these operations and following this rule.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5, 1 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9$$$).The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.It is guaranteed that the total sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the answer.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case one of the optimal sequences of operations is 01101 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 0101 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 011 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 01. This sequence of operations consists of operations $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$2$$$ in this order. It satisfies all rules and gives profit $$$3$$$. It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve higher profit in this test case, so the answer is $$$3$$$.In the second test case one of the optimal sequences of operations is 110001 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 11001 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 1001 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 101.In the third test case one of the optimal sequences of operations is 011110 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 01110 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 1110 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 110 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 11 $$$\rightarrow$$$ 1.
