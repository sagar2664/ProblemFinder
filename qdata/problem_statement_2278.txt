D. Take a Guesstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output  This is an interactive taskWilliam has a certain sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ in his mind, but due to security concerns, he does not want to reveal it to you completely. William is ready to respond to no more than $$$2 \cdot n$$$ of the following questions:  What is the result of a bitwise AND of two items with indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \neq j$$$)  What is the result of a bitwise OR of two items with indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \neq j$$$) You can ask William these questions and you need to find the $$$k$$$-th smallest number of the sequence.Formally the $$$k$$$-th smallest number is equal to the number at the $$$k$$$-th place in a 1-indexed array sorted in non-decreasing order. For example in array $$$[5, 3, 3, 10, 1]$$$ $$$4$$$th smallest number is equal to $$$5$$$, and $$$2$$$nd and $$$3$$$rd are $$$3$$$.InputIt is guaranteed that for each element in a sequence the condition $$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$ is satisfied.InteractionIn the first line you will be given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(3 \le n \le 10^4, 1 \le k \le n)$$$, which are the number of items in the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number $$$k$$$.After that, you can ask no more than $$$2 \cdot n$$$ questions (not including the "finish" operation).Each line of your output may be of one of the following types:   "or i j" $$$(1 \le i, j \le n, i \neq j)$$$, where $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are indices of items for which you want to calculate the bitwise OR.  "and i j" $$$(1 \le i, j \le n, i \neq j)$$$, where $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are indices of items for which you want to calculate the bitwise AND.  "finish res", where $$$res$$$ is the $$$k$$$th smallest number in the sequence. After outputting this line the program execution must conclude. In response to the first two types of queries, you will get an integer $$$x$$$, the result of the operation for the numbers you have selected.After outputting a line do not forget to output a new line character and flush the output buffer. Otherwise you will get the "Idleness limit exceeded". To flush the buffer use:  fflush(stdout) in C++  System.out.flush() in Java  stdout.flush() in Python  flush(output) in Pascal  for other languages refer to documentation If you perform an incorrect query the response will be $$$-1$$$. After receiving response $$$-1$$$ you must immediately halt your program in order to receive an "Incorrect answer" verdict.Hacking To perform a hack you will need to use the following format:The first line must contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(3 \le n \le 10^4, 1 \le k \le n)$$$, which are the number of items in the sequence $$$a$$$ and the number $$$k$$$.The second line must contain $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ $$$(0 \le a_i \le 10^9)$$$, the sequence $$$a$$$.ExampleInput

Interactor returns bitwise AND of the given numbers.or 5 67$$$a_5=3$$$, $$$a_6=5$$$. Interactor returns bitwise OR of the given numbers.finish 5$$$5$$$ is the correct answer. Note that you must find the value and not the index of the kth smallest number.
