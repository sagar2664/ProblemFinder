G. Unusual Minesweepertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp is very fond of playing the game Minesweeper. Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules.There are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known ($$$x_i, y_i$$$). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of $$$k$$$ (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a "plus" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.Also, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines according to the rules described above.Polycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.An empty line is written in front of each test suite.Next comes a line that contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le k \le 10^9$$$) — the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of which describes the $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th mine and the time until its explosion ($$$-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9$$$, $$$0 \le timer \le 10^9$$$). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n$$$ over all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data  — the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.ExampleInput

Note  Picture from examples First example:  $$$0$$$ second: we explode a mine at the cell $$$(2, 2)$$$, it does not detonate any other mine since $$$k=0$$$.  $$$1$$$ second: we explode the mine at the cell $$$(0, 1)$$$, and the mine at the cell $$$(0, 0)$$$ explodes itself.  $$$2$$$ second: we explode the mine at the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$, and the mine at the cell $$$(1, 0)$$$ explodes itself.Second example:  $$$0$$$ second: we explode a mine at the cell $$$(2, 2)$$$ we get:     $$$1$$$ second: the mine at coordinate $$$(0, 0)$$$ explodes and since $$$k=2$$$ the explosion detonates mines at the cells $$$(0, 1)$$$ and $$$(1, 0)$$$, and their explosions detonate the mine at the cell $$$(1, 1)$$$ and there are no mines left on the field.
