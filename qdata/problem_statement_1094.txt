B. Hossam and Friendstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputHossam makes a big party, and he will invite his friends to the party.He has $$$n$$$ friends numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. They will be arranged in a queue as follows: $$$1, 2, 3, \ldots, n$$$.Hossam has a list of $$$m$$$ pairs of his friends that don't know each other. Any pair not present in this list are friends.A subsegment of the queue starting from the friend $$$a$$$ and ending at the friend $$$b$$$ is $$$[a, a + 1, a + 2, \ldots, b]$$$. A subsegment of the queue is called good when all pairs of that segment are friends.Hossam wants to know how many pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ there are ($$$1 \le a \le b \le n$$$), such that the subsegment starting from the friend $$$a$$$ and ending at the friend $$$b$$$ is good.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$), the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integer numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le m \le 10^5$$$) representing the number of friends and the number of pairs, respectively.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i, y_i\le n$$$, $$$x_i \neq y_i$$$) representing a pair of Hossam's friends that don't know each other.Note that pairs can be repeated.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print an integer — the number of good subsegments.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first example, the answer is $$$4$$$.The good subsegments are:[1][2][3][1, 2]In the second example, the answer is $$$5$$$.The good subsegments are:[1][2][3][4][3, 4]
