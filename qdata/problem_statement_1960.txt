B. Squares and Cubestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$8$$$, $$$9$$$, ....For a given number $$$n$$$, count the number of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such $$$x$$$ that $$$x$$$ is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously).InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 20$$$) — the number of test cases.Then $$$t$$$ lines contain the test cases, one per line. Each of the lines contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer you are looking for — the number of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ that Polycarp likes.ExampleInput
