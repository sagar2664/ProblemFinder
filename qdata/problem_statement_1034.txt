A. Flip Flop Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. The integers are either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$. You have to perform the following operation exactly once on the array $$$a$$$:  Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i < n$$$) and flip the signs of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$. Here, flipping the sign means $$$-1$$$ will be $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ will be $$$-1$$$. What is the maximum possible value of $$$a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n$$$ after applying the above operation?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$), the length of the array $$$a$$$.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i = 1$$$ or $$$a_i = -1$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum possible sum of the array $$$a$$$ you can get in a separate line.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first case, we can choose index $$$4$$$ and flip the signs of $$$a_4$$$ and $$$a_5$$$. After this operation, the sum will be $$$-1+1+1+1+1 = 3$$$. We can't make the sum larger than this.In the third case, the only option is to choose the index $$$1$$$.
