F. Making It Bipartitetime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an undirected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where vertex $$$i$$$ has a value $$$a_i$$$ assigned to it and all values $$$a_i$$$ are different. There is an edge between two vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ if either $$$a_u$$$ divides $$$a_v$$$ or $$$a_v$$$ divides $$$a_u$$$.Find the minimum number of vertices to remove such that the remaining graph is bipartite, when you remove a vertex you remove all the edges incident to it.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5\cdot10^4$$$) — the number of vertices in the graph.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th of them is the value $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 5\cdot10^4$$$) assigned to the $$$i$$$-th vertex, all values $$$a_i$$$ are different.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\cdot10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of vertices to remove such that the remaining graph is bipartite.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case if we remove the vertices with values $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ we will obtain a bipartite graph, so the answer is $$$2$$$, it is impossible to remove less than $$$2$$$ vertices and still obtain a bipartite graph. BeforeAfter test case #1 In the second test case we do not have to remove any vertex because the graph is already bipartite, so the answer is $$$0$$$. BeforeAfter test case #2 In the third test case we only have to remove the vertex with value $$$12$$$, so the answer is $$$1$$$. BeforeAfter test case #3 In the fourth test case we remove the vertices with values $$$2$$$ and $$$195$$$, so the answer is $$$2$$$. BeforeAfter test case #4
