E. Tripstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ persons who initially don't know each other. On each morning, two of them, who were not friends before, become friends.We want to plan a trip for every evening of $$$m$$$ days. On each trip, you have to select a group of people that will go on the trip. For every person, one of the following should hold:   Either this person does not go on the trip,  Or at least $$$k$$$ of his friends also go on the trip. Note that the friendship is not transitive. That is, if $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are friends and $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are friends, it does not necessarily imply that $$$a$$$ and $$$c$$$ are friends.For each day, find the maximum number of people that can go on the trip on that day.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le k < n$$$) — the number of people, the number of days and the number of friends each person on the trip should have in the group.The $$$i$$$-th ($$$1 \leq i \leq m$$$) of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1\leq x, y\leq n$$$, $$$x\ne y$$$), meaning that persons $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ become friends on the morning of day $$$i$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ were not friends before.OutputPrint exactly $$$m$$$ lines, where the $$$i$$$-th of them ($$$1\leq i\leq m$$$) contains the maximum number of people that can go on the trip on the evening of the day $$$i$$$.ExamplesInput4 4 22 31 21 31 4Output0033Input5 8 22 14 25 45 24 35 14 13 2Output00033445Input5 7 21 53 22 53 41 25 31 3Output0000344NoteIn the first example,   $$$1,2,3$$$ can go on day $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$.

In the third example,   $$$1,2,5$$$ can go on day $$$5$$$.  $$$1,2,3,5$$$ can go on day $$$6$$$ and $$$7$$$.
