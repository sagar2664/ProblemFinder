Then $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$b$$$ if in the first position $$$i$$$ where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, $$$a_i < b_i$$$. A permutation is lexicographically minimal if it is lexicographically smaller than all other permutations.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 < x \leq n$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if the answer exists, output $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq n$$$) — the lexicographically minimal funny permutation $$$p$$$. Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the permutation $$$[3,2,1]$$$ satisfies all the conditions: $$$p_1=3$$$, $$$p_3=1$$$, and:   $$$p_1=3$$$ is a multiple of $$$1$$$.  $$$p_2=2$$$ is a multiple of $$$2$$$. In the second test case, the permutation $$$[2,4,3,1]$$$ satisfies all the conditions: $$$p_1=2$$$, $$$p_4=1$$$, and:   $$$p_1=2$$$ is a multiple of $$$1$$$.  $$$p_2=4$$$ is a multiple of $$$2$$$.  $$$p_3=3$$$ is a multiple of $$$3$$$. We can show that these permutations are lexicographically minimal.No such permutations exist in the third test case.
