F. Dish Shoppingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$m$$$ people living in a city. There are $$$n$$$ dishes sold in the city. Each dish $$$i$$$ has a price $$$p_i$$$, a standard $$$s_i$$$ and a beauty $$$b_i$$$. Each person $$$j$$$ has an income of $$$inc_j$$$ and a preferred beauty $$$pref_j$$$. A person would never buy a dish whose standard is less than the person's income. Also, a person can't afford a dish with a price greater than the income of the person. In other words, a person $$$j$$$ can buy a dish $$$i$$$ only if $$$p_i \leq inc_j \leq s_i$$$.Also, a person $$$j$$$ can buy a dish $$$i$$$, only if $$$|b_i-pref_j| \leq (inc_j-p_i)$$$. In other words, if the price of the dish is less than the person's income by $$$k$$$, the person will only allow the absolute difference of at most $$$k$$$ between the beauty of the dish and his/her preferred beauty. Print the number of dishes that can be bought by each person in the city.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq m \leq 10^5$$$), the number of dishes available in the city and the number of people living in the city.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$$$), the price of each dish.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq s_i \leq 10^9$$$), the standard of each dish.The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9$$$), the beauty of each dish.The fifth line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$inc_j$$$ ($$$1 \leq inc_j \leq 10^9$$$), the income of every person.The sixth line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$pref_j$$$ ($$$1 \leq pref_j \leq 10^9$$$), the preferred beauty of every person.It is guaranteed that for all integers $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the following condition holds: $$$p_i \leq s_i$$$.OutputPrint $$$m$$$ integers, the number of dishes that can be bought by every person living in the city.ExamplesInput
