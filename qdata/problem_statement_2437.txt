For example, $$$f($$$abacaba$$$) = 3$$$.You are given a string $$$s$$$. Reorder its characters arbitrarily to get a string $$$t$$$ (the number of occurrences of any character in strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ must be equal). The value of $$$f(t)$$$ must be minimized. Out of all options to minimize $$$f(t)$$$, choose the one where string $$$t$$$ is the lexicographically smallest.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 10^5$$$) consisting of lowercase English letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of $$$s$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single string $$$t$$$.The multisets of letters in strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ must be equal. The value of $$$f(t)$$$, the maximum of prefix functions in string $$$t$$$, must be as small as possible. String $$$t$$$ must be the lexicographically smallest string out of all strings satisfying the previous conditions.ExampleInput

NoteA string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \ne b$$$; in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.In the first test case, $$$f(t) = 0$$$ and the values of prefix function are $$$[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ for any permutation of letters. String ckpuv is the lexicographically smallest permutation of letters of string vkcup.In the second test case, $$$f(t) = 1$$$ and the values of prefix function are $$$[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]$$$.In the third test case, $$$f(t) = 5$$$ and the values of prefix function are $$$[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$$$.
