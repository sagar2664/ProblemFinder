A. Deletions of Two Adjacent Letterstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe string $$$s$$$ is given, the string length is odd number. The string consists of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.As long as the string length is greater than $$$1$$$, the following operation can be performed on it: select any two adjacent letters in the string $$$s$$$ and delete them from the string. For example, from the string "lemma" in one operation, you can get any of the four strings: "mma", "lma", "lea" or "lem" In particular, in one operation, the length of the string reduces by $$$2$$$.Formally, let the string $$$s$$$ have the form $$$s=s_1s_2 \dots s_n$$$ ($$$n>1$$$). During one operation, you choose an arbitrary index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i < n$$$) and replace $$$s=s_1s_2 \dots s_{i-1}s_{i+2} \dots s_n$$$.For the given string $$$s$$$ and the letter $$$c$$$, determine whether it is possible to make such a sequence of operations that in the end the equality $$$s=c$$$ will be true? In other words, is there such a sequence of operations that the process will end with a string of length $$$1$$$, which consists of the letter $$$c$$$?InputThe first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) — the number of input test cases.The descriptions of the $$$t$$$ cases follow. Each test case is represented by two lines:  string $$$s$$$, which has an odd length from $$$1$$$ to $$$49$$$ inclusive and consists of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet;  is a string containing one letter $$$c$$$, where $$$c$$$ is a lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. OutputFor each test case in a separate line output: YES, if the string $$$s$$$ can be converted so that $$$s=c$$$ is true; NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$s$$$="abcde". You need to get $$$s$$$="c". For the first operation, delete the first two letters, we get $$$s$$$="cde". In the second operation, we delete the last two letters, so we get the expected value of $$$s$$$="c".In the third test case, $$$s$$$="x", it is required to get $$$s$$$="y". Obviously, this cannot be done.
