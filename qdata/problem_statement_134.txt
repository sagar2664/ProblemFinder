D1. Sum over all Substrings (Easy Version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.For a binary$$$^\dagger$$$ pattern $$$p$$$ and a binary string $$$q$$$, both of length $$$m$$$, $$$q$$$ is called $$$p$$$-good if for every $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq m$$$), there exist indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that:   $$$1 \leq l \leq i \leq r \leq m$$$, and  $$$p_i$$$ is a mode$$$^\ddagger$$$ of the string $$$q_l q_{l+1} \ldots q_{r}$$$. For a pattern $$$p$$$, let $$$f(p)$$$ be the minimum possible number of $$$\mathtt{1}$$$s in a $$$p$$$-good binary string (of the same length as the pattern).You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Find $$$$$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=i}^{n} f(s_i s_{i+1} \ldots s_j).$$$$$$ In other words, you need to sum the values of $$$f$$$ over all $$$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$$ substrings of $$$s$$$.$$$^\dagger$$$ A binary pattern is a string that only consists of characters $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\mathtt{1}$$$.$$$^\ddagger$$$ Character $$$c$$$ is a mode of string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$ if the number of occurrences of $$$c$$$ in $$$t$$$ is at least $$$\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$$$. For example, $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ is a mode of $$$\mathtt{010}$$$, $$$\mathtt{1}$$$ is not a mode of $$$\mathtt{010}$$$, and both $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\mathtt{1}$$$ are modes of $$$\mathtt{011010}$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the length of the binary string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of only characters $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\mathtt{1}$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the sum of values of $$$f$$$ over all substrings of $$$s$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the only $$$\mathtt{1}$$$-good string is $$$\mathtt{1}$$$. Thus, $$$f(\mathtt{1})=1$$$.In the second test case, $$$f(\mathtt{10})=1$$$ because $$$\mathtt{01}$$$ is $$$\mathtt{10}$$$-good, and $$$\mathtt{00}$$$ is not $$$\mathtt{10}$$$-good. Thus, the answer is $$$f(\mathtt{1})+f(\mathtt{10})+f(\mathtt{0}) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2$$$.In the third test case, $$$f$$$ equals to $$$0$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq j \leq 5$$$. Thus, the answer is $$$0$$$.
