B. Fedya and Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor his birthday recently Fedya was given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers arranged in a circle, For each pair of neighboring numbers ($$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_3$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$a_{n - 1}$$$ and $$$a_n$$$, $$$a_n$$$ and $$$a_1$$$) the absolute difference between them is equal to $$$1$$$.Let's call a local maximum an element, which is greater than both of its neighboring elements. Also call a local minimum an element, which is less than both of its neighboring elements. Note, that elements $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_n$$$ are neighboring elements.Unfortunately, Fedya lost an array, but he remembered in it the sum of local maximums $$$x$$$ and the sum of local minimums $$$y$$$.Given $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, help Fedya find any matching array of minimum length.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.Each line of each test case contain two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \le y < x \le 10^{9}$$$) — the sum of local maximums and the sum of local minimums, respectively.OutputFor each test case, in the first line print one integer $$$n$$$ — the minimum length of matching arrays.In the second line print $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \leqslant a_i \leqslant 10^{9}$$$) — the array elements such that the the absolute difference between each pair of neighboring is equal to $$$1$$$.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$.ExampleInput
