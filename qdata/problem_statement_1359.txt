A. Mainak and Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMainak has an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. He will do the following operation to this array exactly once:  Pick a subsegment of this array and cyclically rotate it by any amount.  Formally, he can do the following exactly once:  Pick two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, such that $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$, and any positive integer $$$k$$$.  Repeat this $$$k$$$ times: set $$$a_l=a_{l+1}, a_{l+1}=a_{l+2}, \ldots, a_{r-1}=a_r, a_r=a_l$$$ (all changes happen at the same time). Mainak wants to maximize the value of $$$(a_n - a_1)$$$ after exactly one such operation. Determine the maximum value of $$$(a_n - a_1)$$$ that he can obtain.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 50$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2000$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 999$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum value of $$$(a_n - a_1)$$$ that Mainak can obtain by doing the operation exactly once.ExampleInput

Note In the first test case, we can rotate the subarray from index $$$3$$$ to index $$$6$$$ by an amount of $$$2$$$ (i.e. choose $$$l = 3$$$, $$$r = 6$$$ and $$$k = 2$$$) to get the optimal array: $$$$$$[1, 3, \underline{9, 11, 5, 7}] \longrightarrow [1, 3, \underline{5, 7, 9, 11}]$$$$$$ So the answer is $$$a_n - a_1 = 11 - 1 = 10$$$. In the second testcase, it is optimal to rotate the subarray starting and ending at index $$$1$$$ and rotating it by an amount of $$$2$$$. In the fourth testcase, it is optimal to rotate the subarray starting from index $$$1$$$ to index $$$4$$$ and rotating it by an amount of $$$3$$$. So the answer is $$$8 - 1 = 7$$$.
