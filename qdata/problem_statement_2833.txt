B. Unique Bid Auctiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a game called "Unique Bid Auction". You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_bid_auction (though you don't have to do it to solve this problem).Let's simplify this game a bit. Formally, there are $$$n$$$ participants, the $$$i$$$-th participant chose the number $$$a_i$$$. The winner of the game is such a participant that the number he chose is unique (i. e. nobody else chose this number except him) and is minimal (i. e. among all unique values of $$$a$$$ the minimum one is the winning one).Your task is to find the index of the participant who won the game (or -1 if there is no winner). Indexing is $$$1$$$-based, i. e. the participants are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of participants. The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th participant chosen number.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — the index of the participant who won the game (or -1 if there is no winner). Note that the answer is always unique.ExampleInput
