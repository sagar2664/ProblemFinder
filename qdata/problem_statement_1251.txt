G. Orraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ nonnegative integers. Let's define the prefix OR array $$$b$$$ as the array $$$b_i = a_1~\mathsf{OR}~a_2~\mathsf{OR}~\dots~\mathsf{OR}~a_i$$$, where $$$\mathsf{OR}$$$ represents the bitwise OR operation. In other words, the array $$$b$$$ is formed by computing the $$$\mathsf{OR}$$$ of every prefix of $$$a$$$.You are asked to rearrange the elements of the array $$$a$$$ in such a way that its prefix OR array is lexicographically maximum.An array $$$x$$$ is lexicographically greater than an array $$$y$$$ if in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, $$$x_i > y_i$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ nonnegative integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print $$$n$$$ integers — any rearrangement of the array $$$a$$$ that obtains the lexicographically maximum prefix OR array.ExampleInput
