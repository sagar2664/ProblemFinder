C. Madoka and Formal Statementtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven an array of integer $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. In one operation you can make $$$a_i := a_i + 1$$$ if $$$i < n$$$ and $$$a_i \leq a_{i + 1}$$$, or $$$i = n$$$ and $$$a_i \leq a_1$$$.You need to check whether the array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ can become equal to the array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ in some number of operations (possibly, zero). Two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ are called equal if $$$a_i = b_i$$$ for all integers $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 4 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) – the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) – the elements of the array $$$a$$$.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$) – the elements of the array $$$b$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output "YES" if you can get the array $$$b$$$, otherwise output "NO".You may print each letter in any case (for example, "YES", "Yes", "yes", "yEs" will all be recognized as positive answer).ExampleInput
531 2 51 2 522 21 343 4 1 26 4 2 532 4 14 5 351 2 3 4 56 5 6 7 6Output
YES
NO
NO
NO
YES
NoteIn the first test case, the array $$$a$$$ is already equal to the array $$$b$$$.In the second test case, we can't get the array $$$b$$$, because to do this we need to decrease $$$a_1$$$.In the fifth test case, we can apply operations in order to the elements with indices $$$4, 3, 3,2,2,2,1,1,1,1$$$, and then get the array $$$[5,5,5,5,5]$$$. After that, you can apply operations in order to elements with indices $$$5,4,4,3,1$$$ and already get an array $$$[6,5,6,7,6]$$$.
