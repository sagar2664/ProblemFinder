E1. Square-Free Division (easy version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $$$k = 0$$$.There is an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You should divide it into a minimal number of continuous segments, such that in each segment there are no two numbers (on different positions), whose product is a perfect square.Moreover, it is allowed to do at most $$$k$$$ such operations before the division: choose a number in the array and change its value to any positive integer. But in this version $$$k = 0$$$, so it is not important.What is the minimum number of continuous segments you should use if you will make changes optimally?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le 1000)$$$  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$k = 0$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^7$$$).It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print a single integer  — the answer to the problem.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case the division may be as follows:  $$$[18, 6]$$$  $$$[2, 4]$$$  $$$[1]$$$
