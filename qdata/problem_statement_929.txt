G. Removal Sequencestime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a simple undirected graph, consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th vertex has a value $$$a_i$$$ written on it.You will be removing vertices from that graph. You are allowed to remove vertex $$$i$$$ only if its degree is equal to $$$a_i$$$. When a vertex is removed, all edges incident to it are also removed, thus, decreasing the degree of adjacent non-removed vertices.A valid sequence of removals is a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ $$$(1 \le p_i \le n)$$$ such that the $$$i$$$-th vertex to be removed is $$$p_i$$$, and every removal is allowed.A pair $$$(x, y)$$$ of vertices is nice if there exist two valid sequences of removals such that $$$x$$$ is removed before $$$y$$$ in one of them and $$$y$$$ is removed before $$$x$$$ in the other one.Count the number of nice pairs $$$(x, y)$$$ such that $$$x < y$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$; $$$0 \le m \le \min(10^5, \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2})$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le n - 1$$$) — the degree requirements for each removal.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \le v, u \le n$$$; $$$v \neq u$$$) — the description of an edge.The graph doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$. The sum of $$$m$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.Additional constraint on the input: there always exists at least one valid sequence of removals.OutputFor each testcase, print a single integer — the number of nice pairs of vertices.ExampleInput
