G2. Light Bulbs (Hard Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe easy and hard versions of this problem differ only in the constraints on $$$n$$$. In the hard version, the sum of values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. Furthermore, there are no additional constraints on the value of $$$n$$$ in a single test case.There are $$$2n$$$ light bulbs arranged in a row. Each light bulb has a color from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (exactly two light bulbs for each color).Initially, all light bulbs are turned off. You choose a set of light bulbs $$$S$$$ that you initially turn on. After that, you can perform the following operations in any order any number of times:  choose two light bulbs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ of the same color, exactly one of which is on, and turn on the second one;  choose three light bulbs $$$i, j, k$$$, such that both light bulbs $$$i$$$ and $$$k$$$ are on and have the same color, and the light bulb $$$j$$$ is between them ($$$i < j < k$$$), and turn on the light bulb $$$j$$$. You want to choose a set of light bulbs $$$S$$$ that you initially turn on in such a way that by performing the described operations, you can ensure that all light bulbs are turned on.Calculate two numbers:  the minimum size of the set $$$S$$$ that you initially turn on;  the number of sets $$$S$$$ of minimum size (taken modulo $$$998244353$$$). InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of pairs of light bulbs.The second line of each test case contains $$$2n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le n$$$), where $$$c_i$$$ is the color of the $$$i$$$-th light bulb. For each color from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, exactly two light bulbs have this color.Additional constraint on the input: the sum of values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output two integers:  the minimum size of the set $$$S$$$ that you initially turn on;  the number of sets $$$S$$$ of minimum size (taken modulo $$$998244353$$$).
