B. Long Legstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA robot is placed in a cell $$$(0, 0)$$$ of an infinite grid. This robot has adjustable length legs. Initially, its legs have length $$$1$$$.Let the robot currently be in the cell $$$(x, y)$$$ and have legs of length $$$m$$$. In one move, it can perform one of the following three actions:   jump into the cell $$$(x + m, y)$$$;  jump into the cell $$$(x, y + m)$$$;  increase the length of the legs by $$$1$$$, i. e. set it to $$$m + 1$$$. What's the smallest number of moves robot has to make to reach a cell $$$(a, b)$$$?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 10^9$$$) — the ending cell.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the smallest number of moves the robot is required to make to reach a cell $$$(a, b)$$$ from a cell $$$(0, 0)$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase, the robot can first jump to $$$(0, 1)$$$, then to $$$(1, 1)$$$. If it ever increases the length of its legs, it will only be able to jump past $$$(1, 1)$$$.In the second testcase, the robot can jump to $$$(1, 0)$$$, then increase the length of its length to $$$2$$$ and jump three times to reach $$$(1, 6)$$$.In the third testcase, the robot can increase the length of its legs three times to make it $$$4$$$. Then jump to $$$(0, 4)$$$. Then jump twice to reach $$$(8, 4)$$$.
