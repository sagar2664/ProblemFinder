A. Recovering a Small Stringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputNikita had a word consisting of exactly $$$3$$$ lowercase Latin letters. The letters in the Latin alphabet are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$26$$$, where the letter "a" has the index $$$1$$$, and the letter "z" has the index $$$26$$$.He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer $$$3 + 1 + 20 = 24$$$, because the letter "c" has the index $$$3$$$ in the alphabet, the letter "a" has the index $$$1$$$, and the letter "t" has the index $$$20$$$.However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding the word "ava", the integer $$$1 + 22 + 1 = 24$$$ is also obtained.Determine the lexicographically smallest word of $$$3$$$ letters that could have been encoded.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds: $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \ne b$$$; in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 78$$$) — the encoded word.OutputFor each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded on a separate line.ExampleInput
