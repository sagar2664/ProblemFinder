A. LuoTianyi and the Palindrome Stringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLuoTianyi gives you a palindrome$$$^{\dagger}$$$ string $$$s$$$, and she wants you to find out the length of the longest non-empty subsequence$$$^{\ddagger}$$$ of $$$s$$$ which is not a palindrome string. If there is no such subsequence, output $$$-1$$$ instead.$$$^{\dagger}$$$ A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, strings "z", "aaa", "aba", "abccba" are palindromes, but strings "codeforces", "reality", "ab" are not.$$$^{\ddagger}$$$ A string $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from $$$b$$$. For example, strings "a", "aaa", "bab" are subsequences of string "abaab", but strings "codeforces", "bbb", "h" are not.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first and the only line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 50$$$) consisting of lowercase English letters — the string that LuoTianyi gives you. It's guaranteed that $$$s$$$ is a palindrome string.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest non-empty subsequence which is not a palindrome string. If there is no such subsequence, output $$$-1$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, "abcaba" is a subsequence of "abacaba" as we can delete the third letter of "abacaba" to get "abcaba", and "abcaba" is not a palindrome string. We can prove that "abcaba" is an example of the longest subsequences of "abacaba" that isn't palindrome, so that the answer is $$$6$$$.In the second test case, we can only get "a" and "aa", but they are all palindrome strings, so the answer is $$$-1$$$.
