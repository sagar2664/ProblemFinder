B. Rudolph and Tic-Tac-Toetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRudolph invented the game of tic-tac-toe for three players. It has classic rules, except for the third player who plays with pluses. Rudolf has a $$$3 \times 3$$$ field  — the result of the completed game. Each field cell contains either a cross, or a nought, or a plus sign, or nothing. The game is won by the player who makes a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of $$$3$$$'s of their symbols.Rudolph wants to find the result of the game. Either exactly one of the three players won or it ended in a draw. It is guaranteed that multiple players cannot win at the same time.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of three lines, each of which consists of three characters. The symbol can be one of four: "X" means a cross, "O" means a nought, "+" means a plus, "." means an empty cell.OutputFor each test case, print the string "X" if the crosses won, "O" if the noughts won, "+" if the pluses won, "DRAW" if there was a draw.ExampleInput
