You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:   Split array $$$a$$$ into two (possibly empty) subsequences$$$^\dagger$$$ $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ such that every element of $$$a$$$ is either in $$$s$$$ or $$$t^\ddagger$$$.  For an array $$$b$$$ of size $$$m$$$, define the penalty $$$p(b)$$$ of an array $$$b$$$ as the number of indices $$$i$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$m - 1$$$ where $$$b_i < b_{i + 1}$$$.  The total penalty you will receive is $$$p(s) + p(t)$$$. If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty you will receive.$$$^\dagger$$$ A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.$$$^\ddagger$$$ Some valid ways to split array $$$a=[3,1,4,1,5]$$$ into $$$(s,t)$$$ are $$$([3,4,1,5],[1])$$$, $$$([1,1],[3,4,5])$$$ and $$$([\,],[3,1,4,1,5])$$$ while some invalid ways to split $$$a$$$ are $$$([3,4,5],[1])$$$, $$$([3,1,4,1],[1,5])$$$ and $$$([1,3,4],[5,1])$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible penalty you will receive.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, a possible way to split $$$a$$$ is $$$s=[2,4,5]$$$ and $$$t=[1,3]$$$. The penalty is $$$p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3$$$.In the second test case, a possible way to split $$$a$$$ is $$$s=[8,3,1]$$$ and $$$t=[2,1,7,4,3]$$$. The penalty is $$$p(s)+p(t)=0 + 1 =1$$$.In the third test case, a possible way to split $$$a$$$ is $$$s=[\,]$$$ and $$$t=[3,3,3,3,3]$$$. The penalty is $$$p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0$$$.
