C. Tenzing and Ballstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputEnjoy erasing Tenzing, identified as Accepted!Tenzing has $$$n$$$ balls arranged in a line. The color of the $$$i$$$-th ball from the left is $$$a_i$$$.Tenzing can do the following operation any number of times:  select $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$1\leq i < j \leq |a|$$$ and $$$a_i=a_j$$$,  remove $$$a_i,a_{i+1},\ldots,a_j$$$ from the array (and decrease the indices of all elements to the right of $$$a_j$$$ by $$$j-i+1$$$). Tenzing wants to know the maximum number of balls he can remove.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\leq t\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\leq n\leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of balls.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\leq a_i \leq n$$$) — the color of the balls.It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ of all test cases will not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the maximum number of balls Tenzing can remove.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first example, Tenzing will choose $$$i=2$$$ and $$$j=3$$$ in the first operation so that $$$a=[1,3,3]$$$. Then Tenzing will choose $$$i=2$$$ and $$$j=3$$$ again in the second operation so that $$$a=[1]$$$. So Tenzing can remove $$$4$$$ balls in total.In the second example, Tenzing will choose $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=3$$$ in the first and only operation so that $$$a=[2]$$$. So Tenzing can remove $$$3$$$ balls in total.
