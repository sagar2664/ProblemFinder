C. Advantagetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ participants in a competition, participant $$$i$$$ having a strength of $$$s_i$$$. Every participant wonders how much of an advantage they have over the other best participant. In other words, each participant $$$i$$$ wants to know the difference between $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_j$$$, where $$$j$$$ is the strongest participant in the competition, not counting $$$i$$$ (a difference can be negative).So, they ask you for your help! For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$) output the difference between $$$s_i$$$ and the maximum strength of any participant other than participant $$$i$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The following line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated positive integers $$$s_1$$$, $$$s_2$$$, ..., $$$s_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq s_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the strengths of the participants.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ space-separated integers. For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$) output the difference between $$$s_i$$$ and the maximum strength of any other participant.ExampleInput

NoteFor the first test case: The first participant has a strength of $$$4$$$ and the largest strength of a participant different from the first one is $$$7$$$, so the answer for the first participant is $$$4 - 7 = -3$$$.  The second participant has a strength of $$$7$$$ and the largest strength of a participant different from the second one is $$$5$$$, so the answer for the second participant is $$$7 - 5 = 2$$$. The third participant has a strength of $$$3$$$ and the largest strength of a participant different from the third one is $$$7$$$, so the answer for the third participant is $$$3 - 7 = -4$$$. The fourth participant has a strength of $$$5$$$ and the largest strength of a participant different from the fourth one is $$$7$$$, so the answer for the fourth participant is $$$5 - 7 = -2$$$.
