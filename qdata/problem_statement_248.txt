D. Array Collapsetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$[p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n]$$$, where all elements are distinct.You can perform several (possibly zero) operations with it. In one operation, you can choose a contiguous subsegment of $$$p$$$ and remove all elements from that subsegment, except for the minimum element on that subsegment. For example, if $$$p = [3, 1, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6]$$$ and you choose the subsegment from the $$$3$$$-rd element to the $$$6$$$-th element, the resulting array is $$$[3, 1, 2, 6]$$$.An array $$$a$$$ is called reachable if it can be obtained from $$$p$$$ using several (maybe zero) aforementioned operations. Calculate the number of reachable arrays, and print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le 10^9$$$).Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the number of reachable arrays, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.ExampleInput
