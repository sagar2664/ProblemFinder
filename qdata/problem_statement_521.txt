C. Divisor Chaintime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$x$$$. Your task is to reduce $$$x$$$ to $$$1$$$.To do that, you can do the following operation:  select a divisor $$$d$$$ of $$$x$$$, then change $$$x$$$ to $$$x-d$$$, i.e. reduce $$$x$$$ by $$$d$$$. (We say that $$$d$$$ is a divisor of $$$x$$$ if $$$d$$$ is an positive integer and there exists an integer $$$q$$$ such that $$$x = d \cdot q$$$.) There is an additional constraint: you cannot select the same value of $$$d$$$ more than twice.For example, for $$$x=5$$$, the following scheme is invalid because $$$1$$$ is selected more than twice: $$$5\xrightarrow{-1}4\xrightarrow{-1}3\xrightarrow{-1}2\xrightarrow{-1}1$$$. The following scheme is however a valid one: $$$5\xrightarrow{-1}4\xrightarrow{-2}2\xrightarrow{-1}1$$$.Output any scheme which reduces $$$x$$$ to $$$1$$$ with at most $$$1000$$$ operations. It can be proved that such a scheme always exists.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$2\le x \le 10^{9}$$$).OutputFor each test case, output two lines.The first line should contain an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 1001$$$).The next line should contain $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k$$$, which satisfy the following:  $$$a_1=x$$$;  $$$a_k=1$$$;  for each $$$2 \le i \le k$$$, the value $$$(a_{i-1}-a_i)$$$ is a divisor of $$$a_{i-1}$$$. Each number may occur as a divisor at most twice. ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, we use the following scheme: $$$3\xrightarrow{-1}2\xrightarrow{-1}1$$$.In the second test case, we use the following scheme: $$$5\xrightarrow{-1}4\xrightarrow{-2}2\xrightarrow{-1}1$$$.In the third test case, we use the following scheme: $$$14\xrightarrow{-2}12\xrightarrow{-6}6\xrightarrow{-3}3\xrightarrow{-1}2\xrightarrow{-1}1$$$.
