A. Two Groupstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You want to distribute these $$$n$$$ integers into two groups $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$ (groups can be empty) so that the following conditions are satisfied:  For each $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \leq i \leq n)$$$, $$$a_i$$$ goes into exactly one group. The value $$$|sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|$$$ is the maximum possible among all such ways to distribute the integers.Here $$$sum(s_1)$$$ denotes the sum of the numbers in the group $$$s_1$$$, and $$$sum(s_2)$$$ denotes the sum of the numbers in the group $$$s_2$$$.Determine the maximum possible value of $$$|sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4)$$$  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \leq n \leq 10^5)$$$  — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2 \ldots a_n$$$ $$$(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$$$  — elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer  — the maximum possible value of $$$|sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase, we can distribute as $$$s_1 = \{10\}$$$, $$$s_2 = \{-10\}$$$. Then the value will be $$$|10| - |-10| = 0$$$.In the second testcase, we can distribute as $$$s_1 = \{0, 11, -1\}$$$, $$$s_2 = \{-2\}$$$. Then the value will be $$$|0 + 11 - 1| - |-2| = 10 - 2 = 8$$$.In the third testcase, we can distribute as $$$s_1 = \{2, 3, 2\}$$$, $$$s_2 = \{\}$$$. Then the value will be $$$|2 + 3 + 2| - |0| = 7$$$.In the fourth testcase, we can distribute as $$$s_1 = \{-9, -4, 0\}$$$, $$$s_2 = \{2, 0\}$$$. Then the value will be $$$|-9 - 4 + 0| - |2 + 0| = 13 - 2 = 11$$$.
