B. Consecutive Points Segmenttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given $$$n$$$ points with integer coordinates on a coordinate axis $$$OX$$$. The coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th point is $$$x_i$$$. All points' coordinates are distinct and given in strictly increasing order.For each point $$$i$$$, you can do the following operation no more than once: take this point and move it by $$$1$$$ to the left or to the right (i..e., you can change its coordinate $$$x_i$$$ to $$$x_i - 1$$$ or to $$$x_i + 1$$$). In other words, for each point, you choose (separately) its new coordinate. For the $$$i$$$-th point, it can be either $$$x_i - 1$$$, $$$x_i$$$ or $$$x_i + 1$$$.Your task is to determine if you can move some points as described above in such a way that the new set of points forms a consecutive segment of integers, i. e. for some integer $$$l$$$ the coordinates of points should be equal to $$$l, l + 1, \ldots, l + n - 1$$$.Note that the resulting points should have distinct coordinates.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of points in the set $$$x$$$.The second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_n$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le 10^6$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ is the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th point.It is guaranteed that the points are given in strictly increasing order (this also means that all coordinates are distinct). It is also guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$ ($$$\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer — if the set of points from the test case can be moved to form a consecutive segment of integers, print YES, otherwise print NO.ExampleInput
