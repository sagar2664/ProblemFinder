D. Not a Cheap Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet $$$s$$$ be a string of lowercase Latin letters. Its price is the sum of the indices of letters (an integer between 1 and 26) that are included in it. For example, the price of the string abca is $$$1+2+3+1=7$$$.The string $$$w$$$ and the integer $$$p$$$ are given. Remove the minimal number of letters from $$$w$$$ so that its price becomes less than or equal to $$$p$$$ and print the resulting string. Note that the resulting string may be empty. You can delete arbitrary letters, they do not have to go in a row. If the price of a given string $$$w$$$ is less than or equal to $$$p$$$, then nothing needs to be deleted and $$$w$$$ must be output.Note that when you delete a letter from $$$w$$$, the order of the remaining letters is preserved. For example, if you delete the letter e from the string test, you get tst.InputThe first line of input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. The following are descriptions of $$$t$$$ test cases.Each case consists of two lines.The first of them is the string $$$w$$$, it is non-empty and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Its length does not exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$.The second line contains an integer $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \le p \le 5\,200\,000$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths $$$w$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputOutput exactly $$$t$$$ rows, the $$$i$$$-th of them should contain the answer to the $$$i$$$-th set of input data. Print the longest string that is obtained from $$$w$$$ by deleting letters such that its price is less or equal to $$$p$$$. If there are several answers, then output any of them.Note that the empty string  — is one of the possible answers. In this case, just output an empty string.ExampleInput
