C. Physical Education Lessontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual, everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–$$$k$$$-th" position.As is known, settling in "the first–$$$k$$$-th" position occurs as follows: the first $$$k$$$ people have numbers $$$1, 2, 3, \ldots, k$$$, the next $$$k - 2$$$ people have numbers $$$k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2$$$, the next $$$k$$$ people have numbers $$$1, 2, 3, \ldots, k$$$, and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every $$$2k - 2$$$ positions. Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number $$$k$$$ described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how many natural numbers $$$k$$$ fit under the given constraints.Note that the settling exists if and only if $$$k > 1$$$. In particular, this means that the settling does not exist for $$$k = 1$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x < n \le 10^9$$$) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of different $$$k$$$ that fit under the given constraints.It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.ExampleInput
