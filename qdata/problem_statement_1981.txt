B. Mirror in the Stringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a string $$$s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n$$$ and you stand on the left of the string looking right. You want to choose an index $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n$$$) and place a mirror after the $$$k$$$-th letter, so that what you see is $$$s_1 s_2 \ldots s_k s_k s_{k - 1} \ldots s_1$$$. What is the lexicographically smallest string you can see?A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:   $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$, but $$$a \ne b$$$;  in the first position where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ differ, the string $$$a$$$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $$$b$$$. InputThe first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10\,000$$$): the number of test cases.The next $$$t$$$ lines contain the description of the test cases, two lines per a test case.In the first line you are given one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$): the length of the string.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase English characters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case print the lexicographically smallest string you can see.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case choose $$$k = 1$$$ to obtain "cc".In the second test case choose $$$k = 3$$$ to obtain "cbaabc".In the third test case choose $$$k = 1$$$ to obtain "aa".In the fourth test case choose $$$k = 1$$$ to obtain "bb".
