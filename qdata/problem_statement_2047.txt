C. Minimum Extractiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYelisey has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers.If $$$a$$$ has length strictly greater than $$$1$$$, then Yelisei can apply an operation called minimum extraction to it:   First, Yelisei finds the minimal number $$$m$$$ in the array. If there are several identical minima, Yelisey can choose any of them.  Then the selected minimal element is removed from the array. After that, $$$m$$$ is subtracted from each remaining element. Thus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by $$$1$$$.For example, if $$$a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4]$$$, then the minimum element in it is $$$a_3 = -4$$$, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to $$$a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0]$$$.Since Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array $$$a$$$ to be as big as possible.Formally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array $$$a$$$ to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum). To do this, Yelisey can apply the minimum extraction operation to the array as many times as he wants (possibly, zero). Note that the operation cannot be applied to an array of length $$$1$$$.Help him find what maximal value can the minimal element of the array have after applying several (possibly, zero) minimum extraction operations to the array.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$2t$$$ lines contain descriptions of the test cases.In the description of each test case, the first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the original length of the array $$$a$$$. The second line of the description lists $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines, each of them containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is a single integer — the maximal possible minimum in $$$a$$$, which can be obtained by several applications of the described operation to it.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first example test case, the original length of the array $$$n = 1$$$. Therefore minimum extraction cannot be applied to it. Thus, the array remains unchanged and the answer is $$$a_1 = 10$$$.In the second set of input data, the array will always consist only of zeros.In the third set, the array will be changing as follows: $$$[\color{blue}{-1}, 2, 0] \to [3, \color{blue}{1}] \to [\color{blue}{2}]$$$. The minimum elements are highlighted with $$$\color{blue}{\text{blue}}$$$. The maximal one is $$$2$$$.In the fourth set, the array will be modified as $$$[2, 10, \color{blue}{1}, 7] \to [\color{blue}{1}, 9, 6] \to [8, \color{blue}{5}] \to [\color{blue}{3}]$$$. Similarly, the maximum of the minimum elements is $$$5$$$.
