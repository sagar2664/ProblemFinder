A number is written on each vertex; the number on vertex $$$i$$$ is $$$a_i$$$. Initially there are no edges in the graph.You may add some edges to this graph, but you have to pay for them. The cost of adding an edge between vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ is $$$a_x + a_y$$$ coins. There are also $$$m$$$ special offers, each of them is denoted by three numbers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$w$$$, and means that you can add an edge connecting vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ and pay $$$w$$$ coins for it. You don't have to use special offers: if there is a pair of vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ that has a special offer associated with it, you still may connect these two vertices paying $$$a_x + a_y$$$ coins for it.What is the minimum number of coins you have to spend to make the graph connected? Recall that a graph is connected if it's possible to get from any vertex to any other vertex using only the edges belonging to this graph.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of special offers, respectively.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^{12}$$$) — the numbers written on the vertices.Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each containing three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \le x, y \le n$$$, $$$1 \le w \le 10^{12}$$$, $$$x \ne y$$$) denoting a special offer: you may add an edge connecting vertex $$$x$$$ and vertex $$$y$$$, and this edge will cost $$$w$$$ coins.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to pay to make the graph connected.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first example it is possible to connect $$$1$$$ to $$$2$$$ using special offer $$$2$$$, and then $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$ without using any offers.In next two examples the optimal answer may be achieved without using special offers.
