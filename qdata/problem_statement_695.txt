B. Comparison Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where each character is either < or >.An array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n+1$$$ elements is compatible with the string $$$s$$$ if, for every $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the character $$$s_i$$$ represents the result of comparing $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$, i. e.:  $$$s_i$$$ is < if and only if $$$a_i < a_{i+1}$$$;  $$$s_i$$$ is > if and only if $$$a_i > a_{i+1}$$$. For example, the array $$$[1, 2, 5, 4, 2]$$$ is compatible with the string <<>>. There are other arrays with are compatible with that string, for example, $$$[13, 37, 42, 37, 13]$$$.The cost of the array is the number of different elements in it. For example, the cost of $$$[1, 2, 5, 4, 2]$$$ is $$$4$$$; the cost of $$$[13, 37, 42, 37, 13]$$$ is $$$3$$$.You have to calculate the minimum cost among all arrays which are compatible with the given string $$$s$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines:   the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$);  the second line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ characters. Each character of $$$s$$$ is either < or >. OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum cost among all arrays which are compatible with the given string $$$s$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case of the example, the array can be $$$[13, 37, 42, 37, 13]$$$.In the second test case of the example, the array can be $$$[42, 37, 13, 37, 42]$$$.
