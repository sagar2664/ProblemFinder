D1. Zero-One (Easy Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. In this version, $$$n \le 3000$$$, $$$x \ge y$$$ holds. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.You are given two binary strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero).   Select two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l < r$$$).  Change $$$a_l$$$ to $$$(1 - a_l)$$$, and $$$a_r$$$ to $$$(1 - a_r)$$$.  If $$$l + 1 = r$$$, the cost of the operation is $$$x$$$. Otherwise, the cost is $$$y$$$. You have to find the minimum cost needed to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ or say there is no way to do so.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 600$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of three lines. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$ ($$$5 \le n \le 3000$$$, $$$1 \le y \le x \le 10^9$$$) — the length of the strings, and the costs per operation.The second line of each test case contains the string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The string only consists of digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.The third line of each test case contains the string $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The string only consists of digits $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$3000$$$.OutputFor each test case, if there is no way to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$, print $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, print the minimum cost needed to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, selecting indices $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ costs $$$8$$$, which is the minimum possible cost.In the second test case, we cannot make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$ using any number of operations.In the third test case, we can perform the following operations:  Select indices $$$3$$$ and $$$6$$$. It costs $$$3$$$, and $$$a$$$ is 0101011 now.  Select indices $$$4$$$ and $$$6$$$. It costs $$$3$$$, and $$$a$$$ is 0100001 now. The total cost is $$$6$$$.In the fourth test case, we don't have to perform any operations.
