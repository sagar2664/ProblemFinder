H. BerOS File Suggestiontime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp is working on a new operating system called BerOS. He asks you to help with implementation of a file suggestion feature.There are $$$n$$$ files on hard drive and their names are $$$f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$$$. Any file name contains between $$$1$$$ and $$$8$$$ characters, inclusive. All file names are unique.The file suggestion feature handles queries, each represented by a string $$$s$$$. For each query $$$s$$$ it should count number of files containing $$$s$$$ as a substring (i.e. some continuous segment of characters in a file name equals $$$s$$$) and suggest any such file name.For example, if file names are "read.me", "hosts", "ops", and "beros.18", and the query is "os", the number of matched files is $$$2$$$ (two file names contain "os" as a substring) and suggested file name can be either "hosts" or "beros.18".InputThe first line of the input contains integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10000$$$) — the total number of files.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain file names, one per line. The $$$i$$$-th line contains $$$f_i$$$ — the name of the $$$i$$$-th file. Each file name contains between $$$1$$$ and $$$8$$$ characters, inclusive. File names contain only lowercase Latin letters, digits and dot characters ('.'). Any sequence of valid characters can be a file name (for example, in BerOS ".", ".." and "..." are valid file names). All file names are unique.The following line contains integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 50000$$$) — the total number of queries.The following $$$q$$$ lines contain queries $$$s_1, s_2, \dots, s_q$$$, one per line. Each $$$s_j$$$ has length between $$$1$$$ and $$$8$$$ characters, inclusive. It contains only lowercase Latin letters, digits and dot characters ('.').OutputPrint $$$q$$$ lines, one per query. The $$$j$$$-th line should contain the response on the $$$j$$$-th query — two values $$$c_j$$$ and $$$t_j$$$, where  $$$c_j$$$ is the number of matched files for the $$$j$$$-th query,  $$$t_j$$$ is the name of any file matched by the $$$j$$$-th query. If there is no such file, print a single character '-' instead. If there are multiple matched files, print any.
