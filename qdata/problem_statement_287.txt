D. Jumping Through Segmentstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp is designing a level for a game. The level consists of $$$n$$$ segments on the number line, where the $$$i$$$-th segment starts at the point with coordinate $$$l_i$$$ and ends at the point with coordinate $$$r_i$$$.The player starts the level at the point with coordinate $$$0$$$. In one move, they can move to any point that is within a distance of no more than $$$k$$$. After their $$$i$$$-th move, the player must land within the $$$i$$$-th segment, that is, at a coordinate $$$x$$$ such that $$$l_i \le x \le r_i$$$. This means:  After the first move, they must be inside the first segment (from $$$l_1$$$ to $$$r_1$$$);  After the second move, they must be inside the second segment (from $$$l_2$$$ to $$$r_2$$$);  ...  After the $$$n$$$-th move, they must be inside the $$$n$$$-th segment (from $$$l_n$$$ to $$$r_n$$$). The level is considered completed if the player reaches the $$$n$$$-th segment, following the rules described above. After some thought, Polycarp realized that it is impossible to complete the level with some values of $$$k$$$.Polycarp does not want the level to be too easy, so he asks you to determine the minimum integer $$$k$$$ with which it is possible to complete the level.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$)—the number of test cases. Descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$)—the number of segments in the level.The following $$$n$$$ lines.The $$$i$$$-th line contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$0 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^9$$$)—the boundaries of the $$$i$$$-th segment. Segments may intersect.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer—the minimum value of $$$k$$$ with which it is possible to complete the level.ExampleInput

NoteIn the third example, the player can make the following moves:  Move from point $$$0$$$ to point $$$5$$$ ($$$3 \le 5 \le 8$$$);  Move from point $$$5$$$ to point $$$10$$$ ($$$10 \le 10 \le 18$$$);  Move from point $$$10$$$ to point $$$7$$$ ($$$6 \le 7 \le 11$$$). Note that for the last move, the player could have chosen not to move and still complete the level.
