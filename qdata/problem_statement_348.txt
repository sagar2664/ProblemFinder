A. Game with Integerstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVanya and Vova are playing a game. Players are given an integer $$$n$$$. On their turn, the player can add $$$1$$$ to the current integer or subtract $$$1$$$. The players take turns; Vanya starts. If after Vanya's move the integer is divisible by $$$3$$$, then he wins. If $$$10$$$ moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins.Write a program that, based on the integer $$$n$$$, determines who will win if both players play optimally.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The single line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 1000$$$).OutputFor each test case, print "First" without quotes if Vanya wins, and "Second" without quotes if Vova wins.ExampleInput
