A. Compare T-Shirt Sizestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTwo T-shirt sizes are given: $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The T-shirt size is either a string M or a string consisting of several (possibly zero) characters X and one of the characters S or L.For example, strings M, XXL, S, XXXXXXXS could be the size of some T-shirts. And the strings XM, LL, SX are not sizes.The letter M stands for medium, S for small, L for large. The letter X refers to the degree of size (from eXtra). For example, XXL is extra-extra-large (bigger than XL, and smaller than XXXL).You need to compare two given sizes of T-shirts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.The T-shirts are compared as follows:   any small size (no matter how many letters X) is smaller than the medium size and any large size;  any large size (regardless of the number of letters X) is larger than the medium size and any small size;  the more letters X before S, the smaller the size;  the more letters X in front of L, the larger the size. For example:   XXXS < XS  XXXL > XL  XL > M  XXL = XXL  XXXXXS < M  XL > XXXS InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line, in which $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ T-shirt sizes are written. The lengths of the strings corresponding to the T-shirt sizes do not exceed $$$50$$$. It is guaranteed that all sizes are correct.OutputFor each test case, print on a separate line the result of comparing $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ T-shirt sizes (lines "<", ">" or "=" without quotes).ExampleInput
