He is allowed to perform one type of operation on it (zero or more times):   Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n-1$$$).  Add $$$1$$$ to $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i$$$.  Subtract $$$1$$$ from $$$a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, \ldots, a_n$$$. The values of $$$a$$$ can be negative after an operation.Determine the minimum operations needed to make $$$a$$$ not sorted.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 500$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the values of array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.OutputOutput the minimum number of operations needed to make the array not sorted.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first case, we can perform $$$1$$$ operation to make the array not sorted:   Pick $$$i = 1$$$. The array $$$a$$$ then becomes $$$[2, 0]$$$, which is not sorted. In the second case, we can perform $$$2$$$ operations to make the array not sorted:   Pick $$$i = 3$$$. The array $$$a$$$ then becomes $$$[2, 9, 11, 12]$$$.  Pick $$$i = 3$$$. The array $$$a$$$ then becomes $$$[3, 10, 12, 11]$$$, which is not sorted. It can be proven that $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ operations are the minimal numbers of operations in the first and second test cases, respectively.In the third case, the array is already not sorted, so we perform $$$0$$$ operations.
