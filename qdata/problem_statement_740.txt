A. Love Storytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTimur loves codeforces. That's why he has a string $$$s$$$ having length $$$10$$$ made containing only lowercase Latin letters. Timur wants to know how many indices string $$$s$$$ differs from the string "codeforces".For example string $$$s =$$$ "coolforsez" differs from "codeforces" in $$$4$$$ indices, shown in bold.Help Timur by finding the number of indices where string $$$s$$$ differs from "codeforces".Note that you can't reorder the characters in the string $$$s$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case is one line and contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of exactly $$$10$$$ lowercase Latin characters.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of indices where string $$$s$$$ differs.ExampleInput
