D. Serval and Shift-Shift-Shifttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputServal has two $$$n$$$-bit binary integer numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. He wants to share those numbers with Toxel.Since Toxel likes the number $$$b$$$ more, Serval decides to change $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$ by some (possibly zero) operations. In an operation, Serval can choose any positive integer $$$k$$$ between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, and change $$$a$$$ into one of the following number:  $$$a\oplus(a\ll k)$$$  $$$a\oplus(a\gg k)$$$ In other words, the operation moves every bit of $$$a$$$ left or right by $$$k$$$ positions, where the overflowed bits are removed, and the missing bits are padded with $$$0$$$. The bitwise XOR of the shift result and the original $$$a$$$ is assigned back to $$$a$$$.Serval does not have much time. He wants to perform no more than $$$n$$$ operations to change $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$. Please help him to find out an operation sequence, or determine that it is impossible to change $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$ in at most $$$n$$$ operations. You do not need to minimize the number of operations. In this problem, $$$x\oplus y$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. $$$a\ll k$$$ and $$$a\gg k$$$ denote the logical left shift and logical right shift.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le2\cdot10^{3}$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le2\cdot10^{3}$$$) — the number of bits in numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.The second and the third line of each test case contain a binary string of length $$$n$$$, representing $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, respectively. The strings contain only characters 0 and 1.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot10^{3}$$$.OutputFor each test case, if it is impossible to change $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$ in at most $$$n$$$ operations, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, in the first line, print the number of operations $$$m$$$ ($$$0\le m\le n$$$).If $$$m>0$$$, in the second line, print $$$m$$$ integers $$$k_{1},k_{2},\dots,k_{m}$$$ representing the operations. If $$$1\le k_{i}\le n$$$, it means logical left shift $$$a$$$ by $$$k_{i}$$$ positions. If $$$-n\le k_{i}\le-1$$$, it means logical right shift $$$a$$$ by $$$-k_{i}$$$ positions.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExampleInput

-1NoteIn the first test case:The first operation changes $$$a$$$ into $$$\require{cancel}00111\oplus\cancel{001}11\underline{000}=11111$$$.The second operation changes $$$a$$$ into $$$\require{cancel}11111\oplus\underline{00}111\cancel{11}=11000$$$.The bits with strikethroughs are overflowed bits that are removed. The bits with underline are padded bits.In the second test case, $$$a$$$ is already equal to $$$b$$$, so no operations are needed.In the third test case, it can be shown that $$$a$$$ cannot be changed into $$$b$$$.
