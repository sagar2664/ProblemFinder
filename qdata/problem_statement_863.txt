F1. GCD Master (easy version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on $$$m$$$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$. Each element in $$$a$$$ satisfies $$$1\le a_i \le m$$$.In one operation, you choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$1 \le i < j \le |a|$$$, then append $$$\gcd(a_i,a_j)$$$ to the back of the array and delete $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ from the array. Note that the length of the array decreases by one after this operation.Find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly $$$k$$$ operations.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^6$$$; $$$1\le m \le 10^6$$$; $$$1 \le k \le n-1$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le m$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the maximum possible sum of the array after performing $$$k$$$ operations optimally.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the best way is to choose $$$i=1$$$, $$$j=3$$$ in the first operation. The final sequence is $$$[7,4]$$$.
