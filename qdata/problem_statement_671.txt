A. Game with Boardtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob play a game. They have a blackboard; initially, there are $$$n$$$ integers written on it, and each integer is equal to $$$1$$$.Alice and Bob take turns; Alice goes first. On their turn, the player has to choose several (at least two) equal integers on the board, wipe them and write a new integer which is equal to their sum.For example, if the board currently contains integers $$$\{1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3\}$$$, then the following moves are possible:  choose two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$2$$$, then the board becomes $$$\{2, 2, 2, 2, 3\}$$$;  choose two integers equal to $$$2$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$4$$$, then the board becomes $$$\{1, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$$$;  choose three integers equal to $$$2$$$, wipe them and write an integer $$$6$$$, then the board becomes $$$\{1, 1, 3, 6\}$$$. If a player cannot make a move (all integers on the board are different), that player wins the game.Determine who wins if both players play optimally.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 99$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of integers equal to $$$1$$$ on the board.OutputFor each test case, print Alice if Alice wins when both players play optimally. Otherwise, print Bob.ExampleInput

Bob
Alice
NoteIn the first test case, $$$n = 3$$$, so the board initially contains integers $$$\{1, 1, 1\}$$$. We can show that Bob can always win as follows: there are two possible first moves for Alice.  if Alice chooses two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$2$$$, the board becomes $$$\{1, 2\}$$$. Bob cannot make a move, so he wins;  if Alice chooses three integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$3$$$, the board becomes $$$\{3\}$$$. Bob cannot make a move, so he wins. In the second test case, $$$n = 6$$$, so the board initially contains integers $$$\{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\}$$$. Alice can win by, for example, choosing two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wiping them and writing $$$2$$$ on the first turn. Then the board becomes $$$\{1, 1, 1, 1, 2\}$$$, and there are three possible responses for Bob:  if Bob chooses four integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$4$$$, the board becomes $$$\{2,4\}$$$. Alice cannot make a move, so she wins;  if Bob chooses three integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$3$$$, the board becomes $$$\{1,2,3\}$$$. Alice cannot make a move, so she wins;  if Bob chooses two integers equal to $$$1$$$, wipes them and writes $$$2$$$, the board becomes $$$\{1, 1, 2, 2\}$$$. Alice can continue by, for example, choosing two integers equal to $$$2$$$, wiping them and writing $$$4$$$. Then the board becomes $$$\{1,1,4\}$$$. The only possible response for Bob is to choose two integers equal to $$$1$$$ and write $$$2$$$ instead of them; then the board becomes $$$\{2,4\}$$$, Alice cannot make a move, so she wins.
