B. I Hate 1111time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$x$$$. Can you make $$$x$$$ by summing up some number of $$$11, 111, 1111, 11111, \ldots$$$? (You can use any number among them any number of times).For instance,   $$$33=11+11+11$$$  $$$144=111+11+11+11$$$ InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \leq t \leq 10000)$$$ — the number of testcases.The first and only line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$x$$$ $$$(1 \leq x \leq 10^9)$$$ — the number you have to make.OutputFor each testcase, you should output a single string. If you can make $$$x$$$, output "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, output "NO".You can print each letter of "YES" and "NO" in any case (upper or lower).ExampleInput

NO
NoteWays to make $$$33$$$ and $$$144$$$ were presented in the statement. It can be proved that we can't present $$$69$$$ this way.
