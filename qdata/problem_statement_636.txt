E. Boxes and Ballstime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ boxes placed in a line. The boxes are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Some boxes contain one ball inside of them, the rest are empty. At least one box contains a ball and at least one box is empty.In one move, you have to choose a box with a ball inside and an adjacent empty box and move the ball from one box into another. Boxes $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ are considered adjacent to each other. Boxes $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ are not adjacent.How many different arrangements of balls exist after exactly $$$k$$$ moves are performed? Two arrangements are considered different if there is at least one such box that it contains a ball in one of them and doesn't contain a ball in the other one.Since the answer might be pretty large, print its remainder modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 1500$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 1500$$$) — the number of boxes and the number of moves.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i \in \{0, 1\}$$$) — $$$0$$$ denotes an empty box and $$$1$$$ denotes a box with a ball inside. There is at least one $$$0$$$ and at least one $$$1$$$.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of different arrangements of balls that can exist after exactly $$$k$$$ moves are performed, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first example, there are the following possible arrangements:   0 1 1 0 — obtained after moving the ball from box $$$1$$$ to box $$$2$$$;  1 0 0 1 — obtained after moving the ball from box $$$3$$$ to box $$$4$$$;  1 1 0 0 — obtained after moving the ball from box $$$3$$$ to box $$$2$$$. In the second example, there are the following possible arrangements:   1 0 1 0 — three ways to obtain that: just reverse the operation performed during the first move;  0 1 0 1 — obtained from either of the first two arrangements after the first move.
