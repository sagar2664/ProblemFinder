A. Serval and Mocha's Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMocha likes arrays, and Serval gave her an array consisting of positive integers as a gift.Mocha thinks that for an array of positive integers $$$a$$$, it is good iff the greatest common divisor of all the elements in $$$a$$$ is no more than its length. And for an array of at least $$$2$$$ positive integers, it is beautiful iff all of its prefixes whose length is no less than $$$2$$$ are good. For example:  $$$[3,6]$$$ is not good, because $$$\gcd(3,6)=3$$$ is greater than its length $$$2$$$.  $$$[1,2,4]$$$ is both good and beautiful, because all of its prefixes whose length is no less than $$$2$$$, which are $$$[1,2]$$$ and $$$[1,2,4]$$$, are both good.  $$$[3,6,1]$$$ is good but not beautiful, because $$$[3,6]$$$ is not good. Now Mocha gives you the gift array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ positive integers, and she wants to know whether array $$$a$$$ could become beautiful by reordering the elements in $$$a$$$. It is allowed to keep the array $$$a$$$ unchanged.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\leq t\leq 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\leq n\leq 100$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\leq a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\leq 10^6$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, print Yes if it is possible to reorder the elements in $$$a$$$ to make it beautiful, and print No if not.You can output Yes and No in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, neither $$$[3,6]$$$ nor $$$[6,3]$$$ are beautiful, so it's impossible to obtain a beautiful array by reordering the elements in $$$a$$$.In the second test case, $$$[1,2,4]$$$ is already beautiful. Keeping the array $$$a$$$ unchanged can obtain a beautiful array.
