B. Peculiar Movie Preferencestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMihai plans to watch a movie. He only likes palindromic movies, so he wants to skip some (possibly zero) scenes to make the remaining parts of the movie palindromic.You are given a list $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-empty strings of length at most $$$3$$$, representing the scenes of Mihai's movie.A subsequence of $$$s$$$ is called awesome if it is non-empty and the concatenation of the strings in the subsequence, in order, is a palindrome.Can you help Mihai check if there is at least one awesome subsequence of $$$s$$$?A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, for example strings "z", "aaa", "aba", "abccba" are palindromes, but strings "codeforces", "reality", "ab" are not.A sequence $$$a$$$ is a non-empty subsequence of a non-empty sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly zero, but not all) elements.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of scenes in the movie.Then follows $$$n$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which containing a single non-empty string $$$s_i$$$ of length at most $$$3$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print "YES" if there is an awesome subsequence of $$$s$$$, or "NO" otherwise (case insensitive).ExampleInput
