E. Arithmetic Progressiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem!An arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of integers such that the subtraction of element with its previous element ($$$x_i - x_{i - 1}$$$, where $$$i \ge 2$$$) is constant — such difference is called a common difference of the sequence.That is, an arithmetic progression is a sequence of form $$$x_i = x_1 + (i - 1) d$$$, where $$$d$$$ is a common difference of the sequence.There is a secret list of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.It is guaranteed that all elements $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ are between $$$0$$$ and $$$10^9$$$, inclusive.This list is special: if sorted in increasing order, it will form an arithmetic progression with positive common difference ($$$d > 0$$$). For example, the list $$$[14, 24, 9, 19]$$$ satisfies this requirement, after sorting it makes a list $$$[9, 14, 19, 24]$$$, which can be produced as $$$x_n = 9 + 5 \cdot (n - 1)$$$.Also you are also given a device, which has a quite discharged battery, thus you can only use it to perform at most $$$60$$$ queries of following two types: Given a value $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$), the device will show the value of the $$$a_i$$$. Given a value $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \le x \le 10^9$$$), the device will return $$$1$$$ if an element with a value strictly greater than $$$x$$$ exists, and it will return $$$0$$$ otherwise.Your can use this special device for at most $$$60$$$ queries. Could you please find out the smallest element and the common difference of the sequence? That is, values $$$x_1$$$ and $$$d$$$ in the definition of the arithmetic progression. Note that the array $$$a$$$ is not sorted.InteractionThe interaction starts with a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^6$$$), the size of the list of integers.Then you can make queries of two types: "? i" ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) — to get the value of $$$a_i$$$. "> x" ($$$0 \le x \le 10^9$$$) — to check whether there exists an element greater than $$$x$$$After the query read its result $$$r$$$ as an integer.  For the first query type, the $$$r$$$ satisfies $$$0 \le r \le 10^9$$$.  For the second query type, the $$$r$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. In case you make more than $$$60$$$ queries or violated the number range in the queries, you will get a $$$r = -1$$$. If you terminate after receiving the -1, you will get the "Wrong answer" verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream. When you find out what the smallest element $$$x_1$$$ and common difference $$$d$$$, print  "! $$$x_1$$$ $$$d$$$" And quit after that. This query is not counted towards the $$$60$$$ queries limit.After printing any query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; System.out.flush() in Java; flush(output) in Pascal; stdout.flush() in Python; see documentation for other languages.HacksFor hack, use the following format:The first line should contain an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^6$$$) — the list's size.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the list.Also, after the sorting the list must form an arithmetic progression with positive common difference.ExampleInput
