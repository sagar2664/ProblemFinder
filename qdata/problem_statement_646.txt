D. Row Majortime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe row-major order of an $$$r \times c$$$ grid of characters $$$A$$$ is the string obtained by concatenating all the rows, i.e. $$$$$$ A_{11}A_{12} \dots A_{1c}A_{21}A_{22} \dots A_{2c} \dots A_{r1}A_{r2} \dots A_{rc}. $$$$$$A grid of characters $$$A$$$ is bad if there are some two adjacent cells (cells sharing an edge) with the same character.You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Consider all strings $$$s$$$ consisting of only lowercase Latin letters such that they are not the row-major order of any bad grid. Find any string with the minimum number of distinct characters among all such strings of length $$$n$$$.It can be proven that at least one such string exists under the constraints of the problem.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a string with the minimum number of distinct characters among all suitable strings of length $$$n$$$.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, there are $$$3$$$ ways $$$s$$$ can be the row-major order of a grid, and they are all not bad: tththathatat It can be proven that $$$3$$$ distinct characters is the minimum possible.In the second test case, there are $$$2$$$ ways $$$s$$$ can be the row-major order of a grid, and they are both not bad: iiss It can be proven that $$$2$$$ distinct characters is the minimum possible.In the third test case, there is only $$$1$$$ way $$$s$$$ can be the row-major order of a grid, and it is not bad.In the fourth test case, there are $$$4$$$ ways $$$s$$$ can be the row-major order of a grid, and they are all not bad: ttotomtomatoomaatomtoato It can be proven that $$$4$$$ distinct characters is the minimum possible. Note that, for example, the string "orange" is not an acceptable output because it has $$$6 > 4$$$ distinct characters, and the string "banana" is not an acceptable output because it is the row-major order of the following bad grid: banana
