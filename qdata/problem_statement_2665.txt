A. From Zero To Ytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two positive (greater than zero) integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. There is a variable $$$k$$$ initially set to $$$0$$$.You can perform the following two types of operations:   add $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ (i. e. assign $$$k := k + 1$$$);  add $$$x \cdot 10^{p}$$$ to $$$k$$$ for some non-negative $$$p$$$ (i. e. assign $$$k := k + x \cdot 10^{p}$$$ for some $$$p \ge 0$$$). Find the minimum number of operations described above to set the value of $$$k$$$ to $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integer $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le x, y \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations to set the value of $$$k$$$ to $$$y$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case you can use the following sequence of operations:   add $$$1$$$;  add $$$2 \cdot 10^0 = 2$$$;  add $$$2 \cdot 10^0 = 2$$$;  add $$$2 \cdot 10^0 = 2$$$.  $$$1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7$$$.In the second test case you can use the following sequence of operations:   add $$$3 \cdot 10^1 = 30$$$;  add $$$3 \cdot 10^0 = 3$$$;  add $$$3 \cdot 10^0 = 3$$$;  add $$$3 \cdot 10^0 = 3$$$;  add $$$3 \cdot 10^0 = 3$$$.  $$$30 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 42$$$.
