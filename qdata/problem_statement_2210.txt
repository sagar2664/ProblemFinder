I. Physical Examinationtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp plans to undergo a full physical examination at his local clinic. There are $$$n$$$ doctors, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th doctor takes patients from minute $$$L_i$$$ to minute $$$R_i$$$, so Polycarp can visit him at any minute in this range. It takes each doctor exactly one minute to examine Polycarp's health.Polycarp wants to arrive at the clinic at some minute $$$x$$$ and visit all $$$n$$$ doctors in some order without waiting or visiting any doctor several times.More formally, he chooses an integer $$$x$$$ and a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ (a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that each integer appears exactly once), then proceeds to visit:   doctor $$$p_1$$$ at minute $$$x$$$;  doctor $$$p_2$$$ at minute $$$x+1$$$;  ...  doctor $$$p_n$$$ at minute $$$x+n-1$$$. The $$$p_i$$$-th doctor should be able to take patients at minute $$$x+i-1$$$, so the following should hold: $$$L[p_i] \le x + i - 1 \le R[p_i]$$$.Determine if it's possible for Polycarp to choose such a minute $$$x$$$ and a permutation $$$p$$$ that he'll be able to visit all $$$n$$$ doctors in without waiting or visiting any doctor several times. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of testcases.Then the descriptions of $$$t$$$ testcases follow.The first line of the testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of doctors.The second line of the testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$L_1, L_2, \dots L_n$$$ ($$$1 \le L_i \le 10^9$$$).The third line of the testcase contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$R_1, R_2, \dots R_n$$$ ($$$L_i \le R_i \le 10^9$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase print an answer.If there exists such a minute $$$x$$$ and a permutation $$$p$$$ that Polycarp is able to visit all $$$n$$$ doctors without waiting or visiting any doctor several times, then print $$$x$$$ in the first line and a permutation $$$p$$$ in the second line. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$ in the only line.ExampleInput

NoteIn the third testcase it's impossible to visit all doctors, because Polycarp has to visit doctor $$$2$$$ at minute $$$2$$$ and doctor $$$1$$$ at minute $$$4$$$. However, that would require him to wait a minute between the visits, which is not allowed.In the fourth testcase all doctors take patients in the span of $$$2$$$ minutes. However, since there are three of them, Polycarp can't visit them all.
