D. Palindromes Coloringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters. You can color some letters in colors from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$. It is not necessary to paint all the letters. But for each color, there must be a letter painted in that color.Then you can swap any two symbols painted in the same color as many times as you want. After that, $$$k$$$ strings will be created, $$$i$$$-th of them will contain all the characters colored in the color $$$i$$$, written in the order of their sequence in the string $$$s$$$.Your task is to color the characters of the string so that all the resulting $$$k$$$ strings are palindromes, and the length of the shortest of these $$$k$$$ strings is as large as possible.Read the note for the first test case of the example if you need a clarification.Recall that a string is a palindrome if it reads the same way both from left to right and from right to left. For example, the strings abacaba, cccc, z and dxd are palindromes, but the strings abab and aaabaa — are not.InputThe first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of input data sets in the test. The descriptions of the input data sets follow.The first line of the description of each input data set contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string and the number of colors in which its letters can be painted. The second line of the description of each input data set contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each set of input data, output a single integer  — the maximum length of the shortest palindrome string that can be obtained.ExampleInput

Note In the first test case, $$$s$$$="bxyaxzay", $$$k=2$$$. We use indices in the string from $$$1$$$ to $$$8$$$. The following coloring will work: $$$\mathtt{\mathbf{\color{red}{b}\color{blue}{xy}\color{red}{a}\color{blue}{x}z\color{red}{a}\color{blue}{y}}}$$$ (the letter z remained uncolored). After painting:  swap two red characters (with the indices $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$), we get $$$\mathtt{\mathbf{\color{red}{a}\color{blue}{xy}\color{red}{b}\color{blue}{x}z\color{red}{a}\color{blue}{y}}}$$$;  swap two blue characters (with the indices $$$5$$$ and $$$8$$$), we get $$$\mathtt{\mathbf{\color{red}{a}\color{blue}{xy}\color{red}{b}\color{blue}{y}z\color{red}{a}\color{blue}{x}}}$$$. Now, for each of the two colors we write out the corresponding characters from left to right, we get two strings $$$\mathtt{\mathbf{\color{red}{aba}}}$$$ and $$$\mathtt{\mathbf{\color{blue}{xyyx}}}$$$. Both of them are palindromes, the length of the shortest is $$$3$$$. It can be shown that the greatest length of the shortest palindrome cannot be achieved. In the second set of input data, the following coloring is suitable: $$$[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]$$$. There is no need to swap characters. Both received strings are equal to aa, they are palindromes and their length is $$$2$$$. In the third set of input data, you can color any character and take it into a string. In the fourth set of input data, you can color the $$$i$$$th character in the color $$$i$$$. In the fifth set of input data can be colored in each of the colors of one character. In the sixth set of input data, the following coloring is suitable: $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]$$$. Rearrange the characters so as to get the palindromes abcba and acbca.
