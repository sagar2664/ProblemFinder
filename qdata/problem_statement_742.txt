A. Divisible Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. Please find an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ that is perfect.A perfect array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ satisfies the following criteria:   $$$1 \le a_i \le 1000$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$.  $$$a_i$$$ is divisible by $$$i$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$.  $$$a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n$$$ is divisible by $$$n$$$. InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 200$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 200$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, output an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ that is perfect.We can show that an answer always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.ExampleInput

NoteIn the third test case:   $$$a_1 = 1$$$ is divisible by $$$1$$$.  $$$a_2 = 2$$$ is divisible by $$$2$$$.  $$$a_3 = 3$$$ is divisible by $$$3$$$.  $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$$$ is divisible by $$$3$$$. In the fifth test case:   $$$a_1 = 3$$$ is divisible by $$$1$$$.  $$$a_2 = 4$$$ is divisible by $$$2$$$.  $$$a_3 = 9$$$ is divisible by $$$3$$$.  $$$a_4 = 4$$$ is divisible by $$$4$$$.  $$$a_5 = 5$$$ is divisible by $$$5$$$.  $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3 + 4 + 9 + 4 + 5 = 25$$$ is divisible by $$$5$$$.
