A. Make it Beautifultime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn array $$$a$$$ is called ugly if it contains at least one element which is equal to the sum of all elements before it. If the array is not ugly, it is beautiful.For example:  the array $$$[6, 3, 9, 6]$$$ is ugly: the element $$$9$$$ is equal to $$$6 + 3$$$;  the array $$$[5, 5, 7]$$$ is ugly: the element $$$5$$$ (the second one) is equal to $$$5$$$;  the array $$$[8, 4, 10, 14]$$$ is beautiful: $$$8 \ne 0$$$, $$$4 \ne 8$$$, $$$10 \ne 8 + 4$$$, $$$14 \ne 8 + 4 + 10$$$, so there is no element which is equal to the sum of all elements before it. You are given an array $$$a$$$ such that $$$1 \le a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_n \le 100$$$. You have to reorder the elements of $$$a$$$ in such a way that the resulting array is beautiful. Note that you are not allowed to insert new elements or erase existing ones, you can only change the order of elements of $$$a$$$. You are allowed to keep the array $$$a$$$ unchanged, if it is beautiful.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 50$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_n \le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer as follows:  if it is impossible to reorder the elements of $$$a$$$ in such a way that it becomes beautiful, print NO;  otherwise, in the first line, print YES. In the second line, print $$$n$$$ integers — any beautiful array which can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by reordering its elements. If there are multiple such arrays, print any of them. ExampleInput
