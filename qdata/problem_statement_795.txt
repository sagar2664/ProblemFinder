E. Half-sumtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou're given a multiset of non-negative integers $$$\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$$$.In one step you take two elements $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ of the multiset, remove them and insert their mean value $$$\frac{x + y}{2}$$$ back into the multiset.You repeat the step described above until you are left with only two numbers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$. What is the maximum possible value of their absolute difference $$$|A-B|$$$?Since the answer is not an integer number, output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^6$$$) — the size of the multiset.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the multiset.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer, the answer to the problem modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.Formally, let $$$M = 10^9+7$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first case, you can't do any operations, so the answer is $$$|7-3|=4$$$.In the second case, one of the optimal sequence of operations:   Substitute $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ with $$$1.5$$$;  Substitute $$$10$$$ and $$$11$$$ with $$$10.5$$$;  The difference between $$$1.5$$$ and $$$10.5$$$ is $$$9$$$. In the third case, the exact answer is $$$\frac{3}{2}$$$, and $$$500\,000\,005 \cdot 2 \equiv 3 \pmod{10^9+7}$$$.
