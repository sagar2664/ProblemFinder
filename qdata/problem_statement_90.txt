The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$). It is guaranteed that $$$p$$$ is a permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$p = [2, 1]$$$. The only suitable $$$q$$$ is $$$[1, 2]$$$. Indeed, we need to satisfy the inequality $$$q_1 \neq p_1$$$. It only holds for $$$q = [1, 2]$$$.In the second test case, $$$p = [1, 2, 3]$$$. So $$$q$$$ has to satisfy two inequalities: $$$q_1 \neq p_1$$$ and $$$\max(q_1, q_2) \neq \max(1, 2) = 2$$$. One can prove that this only holds for the following $$$3$$$ permutations:  $$$q = [2, 3, 1]$$$: in this case $$$q_1 = 2 \neq 1$$$ and $$$\max(q_1, q_2) = 3 \neq 2$$$;  $$$q = [3, 1, 2]$$$: in this case $$$q_1 = 3 \neq 1$$$ and $$$\max(q_1, q_2) = 3 \neq 2$$$;  $$$q = [3, 2, 1]$$$: in this case $$$q_1 = 3 \neq 1$$$ and $$$\max(q_1, q_2) = 3 \neq 2$$$.
