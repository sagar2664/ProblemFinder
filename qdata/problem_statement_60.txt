F. Rudolf and Imbalancetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRudolf has prepared a set of $$$n$$$ problems with complexities $$$a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \dots < a_n$$$. He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to add at most one problem to fix it.For this, Rudolf came up with $$$m$$$ models of problems and $$$k$$$ functions. The complexity of the $$$i$$$-th model is $$$d_i$$$, and the complexity of the $$$j$$$-th function is $$$f_j$$$. To create a problem, he selects values $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le m$$$, $$$1 \le j \le k$$$) and by combining the $$$i$$$-th model with the $$$j$$$-th function, he obtains a new problem with complexity $$$d_i + f_j$$$ (a new element is inserted into the array $$$a$$$).To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of $$$a_i - a_{i - 1}$$$ ($$$i > 1$$$).What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at most one problem, created according to the described rules?InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of prepared problems, the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9$$$, $$$a_i < a_{i+1}$$$) — the complexities of the prepared problems.The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m$$$ ($$$1 \le d_i \le 10^9$$$) — the complexities of the models.The fourth line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k$$$ ($$$1 \le f_i \le 10^9$$$) — the complexities of the functions.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf can achieve.ExampleInput
