Uniform Chemistrytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn a parallel universe there are $$$n$$$ chemical elements, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The element number $$$n$$$ has not been discovered so far, and its discovery would be a pinnacle of research and would bring the person who does it eternal fame and the so-called SWERC prize.There are $$$m$$$ independent researchers, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$, that are trying to discover it. Currently, the $$$i$$$-th researcher has a sample of the element $$$s_i$$$. Every year, each researcher independently does one fusion experiment. In a fusion experiment, if the researcher currently has a sample of element $$$a$$$, they produce a sample of an element $$$b$$$ that is chosen uniformly at random between $$$a+1$$$ and $$$n$$$, and they lose the sample of element $$$a$$$. The elements discovered by different researchers or in different years are completely independent.The first researcher to discover element $$$n$$$ will get the SWERC prize. If several researchers discover the element in the same year, they all get the prize. For each $$$i = 1, \, 2, \, \dots, \, m$$$, you need to compute the probability that the $$$i$$$-th researcher wins the prize.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 100$$$) — the number of elements and the number of researchers.The second line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$s_1, \, s_2, \, \dots, \, s_m$$$ ($$$1 \le s_i < n$$$) — the elements that the researchers currently have.OutputPrint $$$m$$$ floating-point numbers. The $$$i$$$-th number should be the probability that the $$$i$$$-th researcher wins the SWERC prize. Your answer is accepted if each number differs from the correct number by at most $$$10^{-8}$$$.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first sample, all researchers will discover element $$$2$$$ in the first year and win the SWERC prize.In the second sample, the last researcher will definitely discover element $$$3$$$ in the first year and win the SWERC prize. The first two researchers have a $$$50\%$$$ chance of discovering element $$$2$$$ and a $$$50\%$$$ chance of discovering element $$$3$$$, and only element $$$3$$$ will bring them the prize.In the third sample, each researcher has an independent $$$50\%$$$ chance of discovering element $$$3$$$ in the first year, in which case they definitely win the SWERC prize. Additionally, if they all discover element $$$2$$$ in the first year, which is a $$$12.5\%$$$ chance, then they will all discover element $$$3$$$ in the second year and all win the prize.
