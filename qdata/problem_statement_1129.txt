A. Extremely Roundtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a positive integer extremely round if it has only one non-zero digit. For example, $$$5000$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$10$$$, $$$200$$$ are extremely round integers; $$$42$$$, $$$13$$$, $$$666$$$, $$$77$$$, $$$101$$$ are not.You are given an integer $$$n$$$. You have to calculate the number of extremely round integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \le x \le n$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then, $$$t$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 999999$$$) — the description of the $$$i$$$-th test case.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the number of extremely round integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$1 \le x \le n$$$.ExampleInput
