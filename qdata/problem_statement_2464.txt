E. Assimilation IVtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp is playing a game "Assimilation IV". In this game he manages a great empire: builds cities and conquers new lands.Monocarp's empire has $$$n$$$ cities. In order to conquer new lands he plans to build one Monument in each city. The game is turn-based and, since Monocarp is still amateur, he builds exactly one Monument per turn.Monocarp has $$$m$$$ points on the map he'd like to control using the constructed Monuments. For each point he knows the distance between it and each city. Monuments work in the following way: when built in some city, a Monument controls all points at distance at most $$$1$$$ to this city. Next turn, the Monument controls all points at distance at most $$$2$$$, the turn after — at distance at most $$$3$$$, and so on. Monocarp will build $$$n$$$ Monuments in $$$n$$$ turns and his empire will conquer all points that are controlled by at least one Monument.Monocarp can't figure out any strategy, so during each turn he will choose a city for a Monument randomly among all remaining cities (cities without Monuments). Monocarp wants to know how many points (among $$$m$$$ of them) he will conquer at the end of turn number $$$n$$$. Help him to calculate the expected number of conquered points!InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 20$$$; $$$1 \le m \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of cities and the number of points.Next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers each: the $$$j$$$-th integer of the $$$i$$$-th line $$$d_{i, j}$$$ ($$$1 \le d_{i, j} \le n + 1$$$) is the distance between the $$$i$$$-th city and the $$$j$$$-th point.OutputIt can be shown that the expected number of points Monocarp conquers at the end of the $$$n$$$-th turn can be represented as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{x}{y}$$$. Print this fraction modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$, i. e. value $$$x \cdot y^{-1} \bmod 998244353$$$ where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is such number that $$$y \cdot y^{-1} \bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.ExampleInput

NoteLet's look at all possible orders of cities Monuments will be build in:   $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$:   the first city controls all points at distance at most $$$3$$$, in other words, points $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$;  the second city controls all points at distance at most $$$2$$$, or points $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$;  the third city controls all points at distance at most $$$1$$$, or point $$$1$$$.  In total, $$$4$$$ points are controlled.  $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$: the first city controls points $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$; the second city — points $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$; the third city — point $$$1$$$. In total, $$$3$$$ points.  $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$: the first city controls point $$$1$$$; the second city — points $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$; the third city — point $$$1$$$. In total, $$$3$$$ points.  $$$[2, 3, 1]$$$: the first city controls point $$$1$$$; the second city — points $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$; the third city — point $$$1$$$. In total, $$$3$$$ points.  $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$: the first city controls point $$$1$$$; the second city — points $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$; the third city — points $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$. In total, $$$3$$$ points.  $$$[3, 2, 1]$$$: the first city controls point $$$1$$$; the second city — points $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$; the third city — points $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$. In total, $$$3$$$ points.  The expected number of controlled points is $$$\frac{4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3}{6}$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$\frac{19}{6}$$$ or $$$19 \cdot 6^{-1}$$$ $$$\equiv$$$ $$$19 \cdot 166374059$$$ $$$\equiv$$$ $$$166374062$$$ $$$\pmod{998244353}$$$
