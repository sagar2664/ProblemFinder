D. Berserk Monsterstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp is playing a computer game (yet again). Guess what is he doing? That's right, killing monsters.There are $$$n$$$ monsters in a row, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The $$$i$$$-th monster has two parameters: attack value equal to $$$a_i$$$ and defense value equal to $$$d_i$$$. In order to kill these monsters, Monocarp put a berserk spell on them, so they're attacking each other instead of Monocarp's character.The fight consists of $$$n$$$ rounds. Every round, the following happens:  first, every alive monster $$$i$$$ deals $$$a_i$$$ damage to the closest alive monster to the left (if it exists) and the closest alive monster to the right (if it exists);  then, every alive monster $$$j$$$ which received more than $$$d_j$$$ damage during this round dies. I. e. the $$$j$$$-th monster dies if and only if its defense value $$$d_j$$$ is strictly less than the total damage it received this round. For each round, calculate the number of monsters that will die during that round.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of three lines:  the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$);  the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$);  the third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$$$ ($$$1 \le d_i \le 10^9$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be equal to the number of monsters that die during the $$$i$$$-th round.ExampleInput

NoteExplanation for the first test case of the example:During the first round, the following happens:  the monster $$$1$$$ deals $$$3$$$ damage to the monster $$$2$$$;  the monster $$$2$$$ deals $$$4$$$ damage to the monster $$$1$$$ and the monster $$$3$$$;  the monster $$$3$$$ deals $$$7$$$ damage to the monster $$$2$$$ and the monster $$$4$$$;  the monster $$$4$$$ deals $$$5$$$ damage to the monster $$$3$$$ and the monster $$$5$$$;  the monster $$$5$$$ deals $$$10$$$ damage to the monster $$$4$$$;  the monster $$$1$$$ does not die, since it received $$$4$$$ damage and its defense is $$$4$$$;  the monster $$$2$$$ dies, since it received $$$10$$$ damage and its defense is $$$9$$$;  the monster $$$3$$$ dies, since it received $$$9$$$ damage and its defense is $$$1$$$;  the monster $$$4$$$ does not die, since it received $$$17$$$ damage and its defense is $$$18$$$;  the monster $$$5$$$ dies, since it received $$$5$$$ damage and its defense is $$$1$$$. After the first round, the monsters $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ stay alive.During the second round, the following happens:  the monster $$$1$$$ deals $$$3$$$ damage to the monster $$$4$$$;  the monster $$$4$$$ deals $$$5$$$ damage to the monster $$$1$$$;  the monster $$$1$$$ dies, since it received $$$5$$$ damage and its defense is $$$4$$$;  the monster $$$4$$$ does not die, since it received $$$3$$$ damage and its defense is $$$18$$$. During the next three rounds, only the $$$4$$$-th monster is alive, so nothing happens.
