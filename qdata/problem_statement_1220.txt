D. ConstructOR time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$d$$$. Your task is to find any integer $$$x$$$ which satisfies all of the following conditions, or determine that no such integers exist:  $$$0 \le x \lt 2^{60}$$$;  $$$a|x$$$ is divisible by $$$d$$$;  $$$b|x$$$ is divisible by $$$d$$$. Here, $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line, containing three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \le a,b,d \lt 2^{30}$$$).OutputFor each test case print one integer. If there exists an integer $$$x$$$ which satisfies all of the conditions from the statement, print $$$x$$$. Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$.If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.
