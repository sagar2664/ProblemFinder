E. Living Sequencetime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn Japan, the number $$$4$$$ reads like death, so Bob decided to build a live sequence. Living sequence $$$a$$$ contains all natural numbers that do not contain the digit $$$4$$$. $$$a = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, \ldots]$$$.For example, the number $$$1235$$$ is part of the sequence $$$a$$$, but the numbers $$$4321$$$, $$$443$$$ are not part of the sequence $$$a$$$.Bob realized that he does not know how to quickly search for a particular number by the position $$$k$$$ in the sequence, so he asks for your help.For example, if Bob wants to find the number at position $$$k = 4$$$ (indexing from $$$1$$$), you need to answer $$$a_k = 5$$$.InputThe first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.In the only line of each test case, there is a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 10^{12}$$$) — the position Bob is interested in.OutputFor each test case, print on a separate line the number $$$a_k$$$ in indexing with $$$1$$$.ExampleInput
