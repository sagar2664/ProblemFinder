B. Luke is a Foodietime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLuke likes to eat. There are $$$n$$$ piles of food aligned in a straight line in front of him. The $$$i$$$-th pile contains $$$a_i$$$ units of food. Luke will walk from the $$$1$$$-st pile towards the $$$n$$$-th pile, and he wants to eat every pile of food without walking back. When Luke reaches the $$$i$$$-th pile, he can eat that pile if and only if $$$|v - a_i| \leq x$$$, where $$$x$$$ is a fixed integer, and $$$v$$$ is Luke's food affinity.Before Luke starts to walk, he can set $$$v$$$ to any integer. Also, for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$), Luke can change his food affinity to any integer before he eats the $$$i$$$-th pile.Find the minimum number of changes needed to eat every pile of food.Note that the initial choice for $$$v$$$ is not considered as a change.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.For each test case, the first line contains two integers, $$$n, x$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq x \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of piles, and the maximum difference between the size of a pile and Luke's food affinity, such that Luke can eat the pile.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output an integer on a separate line, which is the minimum number of changes needed.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, Luke can set $$$v$$$ to $$$5$$$ before he starts to walk. And he can walk straight to eat every piles of food without changing $$$v$$$.In the second test case, Luke can set $$$v$$$ to $$$3$$$ before he starts to walk. And he could change $$$v$$$ to $$$10$$$ before he eats the second pile. After that, he can walk straight to eat remaining food without changing $$$v$$$.In the fourth test case, Luke can set $$$v$$$ to $$$3$$$ before he starts to walk. And he could change $$$v$$$ to $$$8$$$ before he eats the sixth pile. After that, he can walk straight to eat remaining food without changing $$$v$$$.In the fifth test case, Luke can set $$$v$$$ to $$$4$$$ before he starts to walk. And he could change $$$v$$$ to $$$6$$$ before he eats the fourth pile. Then he could change $$$v$$$ to $$$12$$$ before he eats the seventh pile. After that, he can walk straight to eat remaining food without changing $$$v$$$.
