A ticket is considered lucky if the sum of the first three digits is equal to the sum of the last three digits. Given a ticket, output if it is lucky or not. Note that a ticket can have leading zeroes.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of testcases.The description of each test consists of one line containing one string consisting of six digits.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case.

NoteIn the first test case, the sum of the first three digits is $$$2 + 1 + 3 = 6$$$ and the sum of the last three digits is $$$1 + 3 + 2 = 6$$$, they are equal so the answer is "YES".In the second test case, the sum of the first three digits is $$$9 + 7 + 3 = 19$$$ and the sum of the last three digits is $$$8 + 9 + 4 = 21$$$, they are not equal so the answer is "NO".In the third test case, the sum of the first three digits is $$$0 + 4 + 5 = 9$$$ and the sum of the last three digits is $$$2 + 0 + 7 = 9$$$, they are equal so the answer is "YES".
