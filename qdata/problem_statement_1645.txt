Vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Any vertex can be the root of a tree.A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the root.The tree is specified by an array of parents $$$p$$$ containing $$$n$$$ numbers: $$$p_i$$$ is a parent of the vertex with the index $$$i$$$. The parent of a vertex $$$u$$$ is a vertex that is the next vertex on the shortest path from $$$u$$$ to the root. For example, on the simple path from $$$5$$$ to $$$3$$$ (the root), the next vertex would be $$$1$$$, so the parent of $$$5$$$ is $$$1$$$.The root has no parent, so for it, the value of $$$p_i$$$ is $$$i$$$ (the root is the only vertex for which $$$p_i=i$$$).Find such a set of paths that:  each vertex belongs to exactly one path, each path can contain one or more vertices;  in each path each next vertex — is a son of the current vertex (that is, paths always lead down — from parent to son);  number of paths is minimal. For example, if $$$n=5$$$ and $$$p=[3, 1, 3, 3, 1]$$$, then the tree can be divided into three paths:   $$$3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 5$$$ (path of $$$3$$$ vertices),  $$$4$$$ (path of $$$1$$$ vertices).  $$$2$$$ (path of $$$1$$$ vertices).   Example of splitting a root tree into three paths for $$$n=5$$$, the root of the tree — node $$$3$$$. InputThe first line of input data contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.Each test case consists of two lines.The first of them contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$). It is the number of vertices in the tree.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the $$$p$$$ array encodes some rooted tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n$$$ over all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case on the first line, output an integer $$$m$$$ — the minimum number of non-intersecting leading down paths that can cover all vertices of the tree.Then print $$$m$$$ pairs of lines containing path descriptions. In the first of them print the length of the path, in the second — the sequence of vertices specifying that path in the order from top to bottom. You can output the paths in any order.If there are several answers, output any of them.ExampleInput
