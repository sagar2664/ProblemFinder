D1. Too Many Segments (easy version)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.You are given $$$n$$$ segments on the coordinate axis $$$OX$$$. Segments can intersect, lie inside each other and even coincide. The $$$i$$$-th segment is $$$[l_i; r_i]$$$ ($$$l_i \le r_i$$$) and it covers all integer points $$$j$$$ such that $$$l_i \le j \le r_i$$$.The integer point is called bad if it is covered by strictly more than $$$k$$$ segments.Your task is to remove the minimum number of segments so that there are no bad points at all.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 200$$$) — the number of segments and the maximum number of segments by which each integer point can be covered.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain segments. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 200$$$) — the endpoints of the $$$i$$$-th segment.OutputIn the first line print one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \le m \le n$$$) — the minimum number of segments you need to remove so that there are no bad points.In the second line print $$$m$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$) — indices of segments you remove in any order. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.ExamplesInput
