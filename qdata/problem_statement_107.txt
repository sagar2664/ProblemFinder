G. Turtle Magic: Royal Turtle Shell Patterntime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTurtle Alice is currently designing a fortune cookie box, and she would like to incorporate the theory of LuoShu into it.The box can be seen as an $$$n \times m$$$ grid ($$$n, m \ge 5$$$), where the rows are numbered $$$1, 2, \dots, n$$$ and columns are numbered $$$1, 2, \dots, m$$$. Each cell can either be empty or have a single fortune cookie of one of the following shapes: circle or square. The cell at the intersection of the $$$a$$$-th row and the $$$b$$$-th column is denoted as $$$(a, b)$$$.Initially, the entire grid is empty. Then, Alice performs $$$q$$$ operations on the fortune cookie box. The $$$i$$$-th operation ($$$1 \le i \le q$$$) is as follows: specify a currently empty cell $$$(r_i,c_i)$$$ and a shape (circle or square), then put a fortune cookie of the specified shape on cell $$$(r_i,c_i)$$$. Note that after the $$$i$$$-th operation, the cell $$$(r_i,c_i)$$$ is no longer empty.Before all operations and after each of the $$$q$$$ operations, Alice wonders what the number of ways to place fortune cookies in all remaining empty cells is, such that the following condition is satisfied:No three consecutive cells (in horizontal, vertical, and both diagonal directions) contain cookies of the same shape. Formally:  There does not exist any $$$(i,j)$$$ satisfying $$$1 \le i \le n, 1 \le j \le m-2$$$, such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells $$$(i,j), (i,j+1), (i,j+2)$$$.  There does not exist any $$$(i,j)$$$ satisfying $$$1 \le i \le n-2, 1 \le j \le m$$$, such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells $$$(i,j), (i+1,j), (i+2,j)$$$.  There does not exist any $$$(i,j)$$$ satisfying $$$1 \le i \le n-2, 1 \le j \le m-2$$$, such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells $$$(i,j), (i+1,j+1), (i+2,j+2)$$$.  There does not exist any $$$(i,j)$$$ satisfying $$$1 \le i \le n-2, 1 \le j \le m-2$$$, such that there are cookies of the same shape in cells $$$(i,j+2), (i+1,j+1), (i+2,j)$$$. You should output all answers modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$. Also note that it is possible that after some operations, the condition is already not satisfied with the already placed candies, in this case you should output $$$0$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$5 \le n, m \le 10^9, 0 \le q \le \min(n \times m, 10^5)$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$r_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$ and a single string $$$\text{shape}_i$$$ ($$$1 \le r_i \le n, 1 \le c_i \le m$$$, $$$\text{shape}_i=$$$ "circle" or "square"), representing the operations. It is guaranteed that the cell on the $$$r_i$$$-th row and the $$$c_i$$$-th column is initially empty. That means, each $$$(r_i,c_i)$$$ will appear at most once in the updates.The sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$q+1$$$ lines. The first line of each test case should contain the answer before any operations. The $$$i$$$-th line ($$$2 \le i \le q+1$$$) should contain the answer after the first $$$i-1$$$ operations. All answers should be taken modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the second sample, after placing a circle-shaped fortune cookie to cells $$$(1,1)$$$, $$$(1,2)$$$ and $$$(1,3)$$$, the condition is already not satisfied. Therefore, you should output $$$0$$$.
