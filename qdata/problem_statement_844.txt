C. Sum on Subarraystime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor an array $$$a = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$$$, let's denote its subarray $$$a[l, r]$$$ as the array $$$[a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r]$$$.For example, the array $$$a = [1, -3, 1]$$$ has $$$6$$$ non-empty subarrays:  $$$a[1,1] = [1]$$$;  $$$a[1,2] = [1,-3]$$$;  $$$a[1,3] = [1,-3,1]$$$;  $$$a[2,2] = [-3]$$$;  $$$a[2,3] = [-3,1]$$$;  $$$a[3,3] = [1]$$$. You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Construct an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers such that:  all elements of $$$a$$$ are from $$$-1000$$$ to $$$1000$$$;  $$$a$$$ has exactly $$$k$$$ subarrays with positive sums;  the rest $$$\dfrac{(n+1) \cdot n}{2}-k$$$ subarrays of $$$a$$$ have negative sums. InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 30$$$; $$$0 \le k \le \dfrac{(n+1) \cdot n}{2}$$$).OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers — the elements of the array meeting the constraints. It can be shown that the answer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.ExampleInput
