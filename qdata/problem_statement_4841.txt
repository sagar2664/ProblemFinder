B. Maximum Sum of Digitstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer $$$n$$$.Let $$$S(x)$$$ be sum of digits in base 10 representation of $$$x$$$, for example, $$$S(123) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$$$, $$$S(0) = 0$$$.Your task is to find two integers $$$a, b$$$, such that $$$0 \leq a, b \leq n$$$, $$$a + b = n$$$ and $$$S(a) + S(b)$$$ is the largest possible among all such pairs.InputThe only line of input contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \leq n \leq 10^{12})$$$.OutputPrint largest $$$S(a) + S(b)$$$ among all pairs of integers $$$a, b$$$, such that $$$0 \leq a, b \leq n$$$ and $$$a + b = n$$$.ExamplesInput35Output17Input10000000000Output91NoteIn the first example, you can choose, for example, $$$a = 17$$$ and $$$b = 18$$$, so that $$$S(17) + S(18) = 1 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 17$$$. It can be shown that it is impossible to get a larger answer.In the second test example, you can choose, for example, $$$a = 5000000001$$$ and $$$b = 4999999999$$$, with $$$S(5000000001) + S(4999999999) = 91$$$. It can be shown that it is impossible to get a larger answer.
