They have a hypothesis that there is a correlation between the number of draws and fans' desire to watch football matches in the future.In football, two teams play a match. The teams score goals throughout a match. A score "$$$x$$$:$$$y$$$" means that the team we observe scored $$$x$$$ goals and conceded $$$y$$$ goals. If $$$x = y$$$, then the match ends in a draw. If $$$x > y$$$, then the observed team wins, and if $$$x < y$$$, then it loses.To find out if there is a correlation, the scientists gathered information about the results of teams in lower leagues. The information they found is the number of matches played by the team ($$$n$$$), the number of goals scored in these matches ($$$a$$$), and the number of goals conceded in these matches ($$$b$$$). You are given this information for a single team. You are asked to calculate the minimum number of draws that could have happened during the team's matches and provide a list of match scores with the minimum number of draws.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ — the number of matches played by the team ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$). The second line contains an integer $$$a$$$ — the total number of goals scored by the team in all $$$n$$$ matches ($$$0 \le a \le 1000$$$). The third line contains an integer $$$b$$$ — the total number of goals conceded by the team in all $$$n$$$ matches ($$$0 \le b \le 1000$$$).OutputIn the first line, print a single integer $$$d$$$ — the minimum number of draws.In the following $$$n$$$ lines, print a list of match scores, each line in the format "$$$x$$$:$$$y$$$", where $$$x$$$ is the number of goals scored in the match, and $$$y$$$ – the number of goals conceded, so that exactly $$$d$$$ of these matches have ended in a draw. In case multiple such lists of match scores exist, print any of them.ExamplesInput
