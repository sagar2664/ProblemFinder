G. Weighted Increasing Subsequencestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given the sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The sequence of indices $$$i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k$$$ of length $$$k$$$ denotes the subsequence $$$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots, a_{i_k}$$$ of length $$$k$$$ of sequence $$$a$$$.The subsequence $$$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots, a_{i_k}$$$ of length $$$k$$$ of sequence $$$a$$$ is called increasing subsequence if $$$a_{i_j} < a_{i_{j+1}}$$$ for each $$$1 \leq j < k$$$.The weight of the increasing subsequence $$$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots, a_{i_k}$$$ of length $$$k$$$ of sequence $$$a$$$ is the number of $$$1 \leq j \leq k$$$, such that exists index $$$i_k < x \leq n$$$ and $$$a_x > a_{i_j}$$$.For example, if $$$a = [6, 4, 8, 6, 5]$$$, then the sequence of indices $$$i = [2, 4]$$$ denotes increasing subsequence $$$[4, 6]$$$ of sequence $$$a$$$. The weight of this increasing subsequence is $$$1$$$, because for $$$j = 1$$$ exists $$$x = 5$$$ and $$$a_5 = 5 > a_{i_1} = 4$$$, but for $$$j = 2$$$ such $$$x$$$ doesn't exist.Find the sum of weights of all increasing subsequences of $$$a$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the sum of weights of all increasing subsequences $$$a$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case the following increasing subsequences of $$$a$$$ have not zero weight:   The weight of $$$[a_1] = [6]$$$ is $$$1$$$.  The weight of $$$[a_2] = [4]$$$ is $$$1$$$.  The weight of $$$[a_2, a_3] = [4, 8]$$$ is $$$1$$$.  The weight of $$$[a_2, a_4] = [4, 6]$$$ is $$$1$$$.  The sum of weights of increasing subsequences is $$$4$$$.In the second test case there are $$$7$$$ increasing subsequences of $$$a$$$ with not zero weight: $$$3$$$ with weight $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ with weight $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$ with weight $$$3$$$. The sum of weights is $$$12$$$.
