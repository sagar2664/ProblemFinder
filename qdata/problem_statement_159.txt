E. Vlad and an Odd Orderingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVladislav has $$$n$$$ cards numbered $$$1, 2, \dots, n$$$. He wants to lay them down in a row as follows:   First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.  Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. $$$2$$$ multiplied by an odd number).  Next, he lays down all cards that are $$$3$$$ times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. $$$3$$$ multiplied by an odd number).  Next, he lays down all cards that are $$$4$$$ times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. $$$4$$$ multiplied by an odd number).  And so on, until all cards are laid down.  What is the $$$k$$$-th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a card down, he cannot use that card again.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you need to output.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the $$$k$$$-th card Vladislav lays down.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first seven test cases, $$$n=7$$$. Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:   First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$7$$$.  Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order $$$2$$$, $$$6$$$.  Next, there are no remaining cards that are $$$3$$$ times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.)  Next — all cards that are $$$4$$$ times an odd number, and there is only one such card: $$$4$$$.  There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops.  Thus the order of cards is $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$7$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$4$$$.
