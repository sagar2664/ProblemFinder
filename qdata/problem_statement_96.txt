E. Distance Learning Courses in MACtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe New Year has arrived in the Master's Assistance Center, which means it's time to introduce a new feature!Now students are given distance learning courses, with a total of $$$n$$$ courses available. For the $$$i$$$-th distance learning course, a student can receive a grade ranging from $$$x_i$$$ to $$$y_i$$$.However, not all courses may be available to each student. Specifically, the $$$j$$$-th student is only given courses with numbers from $$$l_j$$$ to $$$r_j$$$, meaning the distance learning courses with numbers $$$l_j, l_j + 1, \ldots, r_j$$$.The creators of the distance learning courses have decided to determine the final grade in a special way. Let the $$$j$$$-th student receive grades $$$c_{l_j}, c_{l_j + 1}, \ldots, c_{r_j}$$$ for their distance learning courses. Then their final grade will be equal to $$$c_{l_j}$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$c_{l_j + 1}$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$\ldots$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$c_{r_j}$$$, where $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation.Since the chatbot for solving distance learning courses is broken, the students have asked for your help. For each of the $$$q$$$ students, tell them the maximum final grade they can achieve.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of distance learning courses.Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$0 \le x_i \le y_i < 2^{30}$$$) — the minimum and maximum grade that can be received for the $$$i$$$-th course.The next line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 2\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of students.Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_j$$$ and $$$r_j$$$ ($$$1 \le l_j \le r_j \le n$$$) — the minimum and maximum course numbers accessible to the $$$j$$$-th student.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$q$$$ integers, where the $$$j$$$-th integer is the maximum final grade that the $$$j$$$-th student can achieve.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case:  The maximum grade for the first student is $$$1$$$:   On the first distance learning course, he will receive a grade of $$$1$$$.  Therefore, the final grade is $$$1$$$.  The maximum grade for the second student is $$$5$$$:   On the first distance learning course, he will receive a grade of $$$1$$$.  On the second distance learning course, he will receive a grade of $$$4$$$.  Therefore, the final grade is $$$1$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$5$$$. The maximum grade for the third student is $$$4$$$:   On the second distance learning course, he will receive a grade of $$$4$$$.  Therefore, the final grade is $$$4$$$. In the second test case:  The maximum grade for the first student is $$$15$$$:   On the first distance learning course, he will receive a grade of $$$7$$$.  On the second distance learning course, he will receive a grade of $$$4$$$.  On the third distance learning course, he will receive a grade of $$$8$$$.  Therefore, the final grade is $$$7$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$4$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$8$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$15$$$.  The maximum grade for the second student is $$$11$$$:   On the third distance learning course, he will receive a grade of $$$9$$$.  On the fourth distance learning course, he will receive a grade of $$$2$$$.  Therefore, the final grade is $$$9$$$ $$$|$$$ $$$2$$$ $$$=$$$ $$$11$$$.
