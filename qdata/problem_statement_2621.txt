B. Let's Go Hikingtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOn a weekend, Qingshan suggests that she and her friend Daniel go hiking. Unfortunately, they are busy high school students, so they can only go hiking on scratch paper.A permutation $$$p$$$ is written from left to right on the paper. First Qingshan chooses an integer index $$$x$$$ ($$$1\le x\le n$$$) and tells it to Daniel. After that, Daniel chooses another integer index $$$y$$$ ($$$1\le y\le n$$$, $$$y \ne x$$$).The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Qingshan moves first. The rules follow:   If it is Qingshan's turn, Qingshan must change $$$x$$$ to such an index $$$x'$$$ that $$$1\le x'\le n$$$, $$$|x'-x|=1$$$, $$$x'\ne y$$$, and $$$p_{x'}<p_x$$$ at the same time.  If it is Daniel's turn, Daniel must change $$$y$$$ to such an index $$$y'$$$ that $$$1\le y'\le n$$$, $$$|y'-y|=1$$$, $$$y'\ne x$$$, and $$$p_{y'}>p_y$$$ at the same time. The person who can't make her or his move loses, and the other wins. You, as Qingshan's fan, are asked to calculate the number of possible $$$x$$$ to make Qingshan win in the case both players play optimally.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation.The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\le p_i\le n$$$) — the permutation.OutputPrint the number of possible values of $$$x$$$ that Qingshan can choose to make her win.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first test case, Qingshan can only choose $$$x=3$$$ to win, so the answer is $$$1$$$.In the second test case, if Qingshan will choose $$$x=4$$$, Daniel can choose $$$y=1$$$. In the first turn (Qingshan's) Qingshan chooses $$$x'=3$$$ and changes $$$x$$$ to $$$3$$$. In the second turn (Daniel's) Daniel chooses $$$y'=2$$$ and changes $$$y$$$ to $$$2$$$. Qingshan can't choose $$$x'=2$$$ because $$$y=2$$$ at this time. Then Qingshan loses.
