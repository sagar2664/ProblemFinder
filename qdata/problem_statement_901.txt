A. Is It a Cat?time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou were walking down the street and heard a sound. The sound was described by the string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin characters. Now you want to find out if the sound was a cat meowing.For the sound to be a meowing, the string can only contain the letters 'm', 'e', 'o' and 'w', in either uppercase or lowercase. Also:   string must start with non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'm' or 'M'  it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'e' or 'E'  it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'o' or 'O'  it must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters 'w' or 'W', this sequence ends the string, after it immediately comes the string end For example, strings "meow", "mmmEeOWww", "MeOooOw" describe a meowing, but strings "Mweo", "MeO", "moew", "MmEW", "meowmeow" do not.Determine whether the sound you heard was a cat meowing or something else.InputThe first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 50$$$) — the length of the string describing the sound.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters. The string describes the sound you heard and consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. OutputFor each test case, output on a separate line:   YES if the sound was a cat meowing;  NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive response).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the string consists of a sequence of characters 'm', 'e', 'O', 'w', which satisfies the definition of meowing.In the second test case, the string consists of a sequence of $$$3$$$ characters 'm' and 'M', one 'e', a sequence of $$$3$$$ characters 'o' and 'O' and a sequence of $$$7$$$ characters 'w' and 'W', which satisfies the definition of meowing.In the third test case, the string does not describe a meowing because it lacks a sequence of 'o' or 'O' characters between 'e' and 'w'.In the fourth test case, the string contains the character 'U', so it does not describe a meowing.
