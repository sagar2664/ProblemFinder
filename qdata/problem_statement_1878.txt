A. Div. 7time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$n$$$. You have to change the minimum number of digits in it in such a way that the resulting number does not have any leading zeroes and is divisible by $$$7$$$.If there are multiple ways to do it, print any of them. If the given number is already divisible by $$$7$$$, leave it unchanged.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 990$$$) — the number of test cases.Then the test cases follow, each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$10 \le n \le 999$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer without any leading zeroes — the result of your changes (i. e. the integer that is divisible by $$$7$$$ and can be obtained by changing the minimum possible number of digits in $$$n$$$).If there are multiple ways to apply changes, print any resulting number. If the given number is already divisible by $$$7$$$, just print it.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case of the example, $$$42$$$ is already divisible by $$$7$$$, so there's no need to change it.In the second test case of the example, there are multiple answers — $$$28$$$, $$$21$$$ or $$$63$$$.In the third test case of the example, other possible answers are $$$357$$$, $$$371$$$ and $$$378$$$. Note that you cannot print $$$077$$$ or $$$77$$$.
