For each $$$1 < i \le k$$$ the following holds: $$$a_i \geq a_{i - 1}$$$, $$$b_i \geq b_{i - 1}$$$, and $$$a_i + b_i \neq a_{i - 1} + b_{i - 1}$$$.Find the sum of $$$|a|$$$ over all good pairs of arrays $$$(a,b)$$$. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4)$$$  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \leq n, m \leq 5 \cdot 10^6)$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^6$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer  — the sum of $$$|a|$$$ over all good pairs of arrays $$$(a,b)$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase, the good pairs of arrays are   $$$([0, 1], [0, 1])$$$, length = $$$2$$$.  $$$([0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1])$$$, length = $$$3$$$.  $$$([0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1])$$$, length = $$$3$$$. Hence the sum of the lengths would be $$${2 + 3 + 3} = 8$$$.
