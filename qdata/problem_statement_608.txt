Since math isn't his strongest point, he asks you to determine if you can choose any two digits to make a sum greater or equal to $$$10$$$.Output "YES" if there is such a pair, and "NO" otherwise.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains three digits $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output "YES" if such a pair exists, and "NO" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput

NoteFor the first test case, by choosing the digits $$$8$$$ and $$$2$$$ we can obtain a sum of $$$8 + 2 = 10$$$ which satisfies the condition, thus the output should be "YES".For the second test case, any combination of chosen digits won't be at least $$$10$$$, thus the output should be "NO" (note that we can not choose the digit on the same position twice).For the third test case, any combination of chosen digits will have a sum equal to $$$18$$$, thus the output should be "YES".
