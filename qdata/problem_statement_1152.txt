Come and do your best if you want to have as much IQ as me!" In today's math class, Doremy is teaching everyone subtraction. Now she gives you a quiz to prove that you are paying attention in class.You are given a set $$$S$$$ containing positive integers. You may perform the following operation some (possibly zero) number of times:  choose two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from the set $$$S$$$ such that $$$x > y$$$ and $$$x - y$$$ is not in the set $$$S$$$.  add $$$x-y$$$ into the set $$$S$$$. You need to tell Doremy the maximum possible number of integers in $$$S$$$ if the operations are performed optimally. It can be proven that this number is finite.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n\le 10^5$$$) — the size of the set $$$S$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_n \le 10^9$$$) — the positive integers in $$$S$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, you need to output the maximum possible number of integers in $$$S$$$. It can be proven that this value is finite.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, no such $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ exist. The maximum possible number of integers in $$$S$$$ is $$$2$$$.In the second test case,  $$$S=\{5,10,25\}$$$ at first. You can choose $$$x=25$$$, $$$y=10$$$, then add $$$x-y=15$$$ to the set.  $$$S=\{5,10,15,25\}$$$ now. You can choose $$$x=25$$$, $$$y=5$$$, then add $$$x-y=20$$$ to the set.  $$$S=\{5,10,15,20,25\}$$$ now. You can not perform any operation now. After performing all operations, the number of integers in $$$S$$$ is $$$5$$$. It can be proven that no other sequence of operations allows $$$S$$$ to contain more than $$$5$$$ integers.
