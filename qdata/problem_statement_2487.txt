C. Not Adjacent Matrixtime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe will consider the numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ as adjacent if they differ by exactly one, that is, $$$|a-b|=1$$$.We will consider cells of a square matrix $$$n \times n$$$ as adjacent if they have a common side, that is, for cell $$$(r, c)$$$ cells $$$(r, c-1)$$$, $$$(r, c+1)$$$, $$$(r-1, c)$$$ and $$$(r+1, c)$$$ are adjacent to it.For a given number $$$n$$$, construct a square matrix $$$n \times n$$$ such that:   Each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n^2$$$ occurs in this matrix exactly once;  If $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ and $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$ are adjacent cells, then the numbers written in them must not be adjacent. InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is characterized by one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, output:   -1, if the required matrix does not exist;  the required matrix, otherwise (any such matrix if many of them exist). The matrix should be outputted as $$$n$$$ lines, where each line contains $$$n$$$ integers.ExampleInput
