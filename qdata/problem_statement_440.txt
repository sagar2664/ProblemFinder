Next you will be given a positive integer $$$k$$$ and two arrays, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ of length $$$k$$$.It is guaranteed that the following conditions hold for these 2 arrays:   $$$l_1 = 1$$$;  $$$r_k = n$$$;  $$$l_i \le r_i$$$, for each positive integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le k$$$;  $$$l_i = r_{i-1}+1$$$, for each positive integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$2 \le i \le k$$$; Now you will be given a positive integer $$$q$$$ which represents the number of modifications you need to do on $$$s$$$.Each modification is defined with one positive integer $$$x$$$:   Find an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$l_i \le x \le r_i$$$ (notice that such $$$i$$$ is unique).  Let $$$a=\min(x, r_i+l_i-x)$$$ and let $$$b=\max(x, r_i+l_i-x)$$$.  Reverse the substring of $$$s$$$ from index $$$a$$$ to index $$$b$$$. Reversing the substring $$$[a, b]$$$ of a string $$$s$$$ means to make $$$s$$$ equal to $$$s_1, s_2, \dots, s_{a-1},\ s_b, s_{b-1}, \dots, s_{a+1}, s_a,\ s_{b+1}, s_{b+2}, \dots, s_{n-1}, s_n$$$.Print $$$s$$$ after the last modification is finished.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$, and the length of arrays $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$.The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$ |s| = n$$$) containing lowercase Latin letters — the initial string.The third line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$l_1, l_2, \dots, l_k$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le n$$$) — the array $$$l$$$.The fourth line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k$$$ ($$$1 \le r_i \le n$$$) — the array $$$r$$$.The fifth line of each test case contains a positive integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $$$) — the number of modifications you need to do to $$$s$$$.The sixth line of each test case contains $$$q$$$ positive integers $$$x_1, x_2, \dots, x_q$$$ ($$$1\le x_i \le n$$$) — the description of the modifications.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$.It is guaranteed that the conditions in the statement hold for the arrays $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$.OutputFor each test case, in a new line, output the string $$$s$$$ after the last modification is done.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case:The initial string is "abcd". In the first modification, we have $$$x=1$$$. Since $$$l_1=1\leq x \leq r_1=2$$$, we find the index $$$i = 1$$$. We reverse the substring from index $$$x=1$$$ to $$$l_1+r_1-x=1+2-1=2$$$. After this modification, our string is "bacd". In the second modification (and the last modification), we have $$$x=3$$$. Since $$$l_2=3\leq x \leq r_2=4$$$, we find the index $$$i = 2$$$. We reverse the substring from index $$$x=3$$$ to $$$l_2+r_2-x=3+4-3=4$$$. After this modification, our string is "badc".In the second test case:The initial string is "abcde". In the first modification, we have $$$x=1$$$. Since $$$l_1=1\leq x \leq r_1=1$$$, we find the index $$$i = 1$$$. We reverse the substring from index $$$x=1$$$ to $$$l_1+r_1-x=1+1-1=1$$$. After this modification, our string hasn't changed ("abcde"). In the second modification, we have $$$x=2$$$. Since $$$l_2=2\leq x \leq r_2=2$$$, we find the index $$$i = 2$$$. We reverse the substring from index $$$x=2$$$ to $$$l_2+r_2-x=2+2-2=2$$$. After this modification, our string hasn't changed ("abcde"). In the third modification (and the last modification), we have $$$x=3$$$. Since $$$l_3=3\leq x \leq r_3=5$$$, we find the index $$$i = 3$$$. We reverse the substring from index $$$x=3$$$ to $$$l_3+r_3-x=3+5-3=5$$$. After this modification, our string is "abedc".
