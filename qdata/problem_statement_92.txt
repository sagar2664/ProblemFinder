C. Pokémon Arenatime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are at a dueling arena. You also possess $$$n$$$ Pokémons. Initially, only the $$$1$$$-st Pokémon is standing in the arena.Each Pokémon has $$$m$$$ attributes. The $$$j$$$-th attribute of the $$$i$$$-th Pokémon is $$$a_{i,j}$$$. Each Pokémon also has a cost to be hired: the $$$i$$$-th Pokémon's cost is $$$c_i$$$.You want to have the $$$n$$$-th Pokémon stand in the arena. To do that, you can perform the following two types of operations any number of times in any order:   Choose three integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le j \le m$$$, $$$k > 0$$$), increase $$$a_{i,j}$$$ by $$$k$$$ permanently. The cost of this operation is $$$k$$$.  Choose two integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le j \le m$$$) and hire the $$$i$$$-th Pokémon to duel with the current Pokémon in the arena based on the $$$j$$$-th attribute. The $$$i$$$-th Pokémon will win if $$$a_{i,j}$$$ is greater than or equal to the $$$j$$$-th attribute of the current Pokémon in the arena (otherwise, it will lose). After the duel, only the winner will stand in the arena. The cost of this operation is $$$c_i$$$. Find the minimum cost you need to pay to have the $$$n$$$-th Pokémon stand in the arena.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 4 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \leq n \cdot m \leq 4 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le 10^9$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \ldots, a_{i,m}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_{i,j} \le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum cost to make the $$$n$$$-th Pokémon stand in the arena.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the attribute array of the $$$1$$$-st Pokémon (which is standing in the arena initially) is $$$[2,9,9]$$$.In the first operation, you can choose $$$i=3$$$, $$$j=1$$$, $$$k=1$$$, and increase $$$a_{3,1}$$$ by $$$1$$$ permanently. Now the attribute array of the $$$3$$$-rd Pokémon is $$$[2,2,1]$$$. The cost of this operation is $$$k = 1$$$.In the second operation, you can choose $$$i=3$$$, $$$j=1$$$, and hire the $$$3$$$-rd Pokémon to duel with the current Pokémon in the arena based on the $$$1$$$-st attribute. Since $$$a_{i,j}=a_{3,1}=2 \ge 2=a_{1,1}$$$, the $$$3$$$-rd Pokémon will win. The cost of this operation is $$$c_3 = 1$$$.Thus, we have made the $$$3$$$-rd Pokémon stand in the arena within the cost of $$$2$$$. It can be proven that $$$2$$$ is minimum possible.In the second test case, the attribute array of the $$$1$$$-st Pokémon in the arena is $$$[9,9,9]$$$.In the first operation, you can choose $$$i=2$$$, $$$j=3$$$, $$$k=2$$$, and increase $$$a_{2,3}$$$ by $$$2$$$ permanently. Now the attribute array of the $$$2$$$-nd Pokémon is $$$[6,1,9]$$$. The cost of this operation is $$$k = 2$$$.In the second operation, you can choose $$$i=2$$$, $$$j=3$$$, and hire the $$$2$$$-nd Pokémon to duel with the current Pokémon in the arena based on the $$$3$$$-rd attribute. Since $$$a_{i,j}=a_{2,3}=9 \ge 9=a_{1,3}$$$, the $$$2$$$-nd Pokémon will win. The cost of this operation is $$$c_2 = 3$$$.In the third operation, you can choose $$$i=3$$$, $$$j=2$$$, and hire the $$$3$$$-rd Pokémon to duel with the current Pokémon in the arena based on the $$$2$$$-nd attribute. Since $$$a_{i,j}=a_{1,2}=2 \ge 1=a_{2,2}$$$, the $$$3$$$-rd Pokémon can win. The cost of this operation is $$$c_3 = 1$$$.Thus, we have made the $$$3$$$-rd Pokémon stand in the arena within the cost of $$$6$$$. It can be proven that $$$6$$$ is minimum possible.
