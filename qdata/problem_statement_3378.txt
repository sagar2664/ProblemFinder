A. Sum of Round Numberstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called round if it is of the form d00...0. In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. In particular, all numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ (inclusive) are round.For example, the following numbers are round: $$$4000$$$, $$$1$$$, $$$9$$$, $$$800$$$, $$$90$$$. The following numbers are not round: $$$110$$$, $$$707$$$, $$$222$$$, $$$1001$$$.You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^4$$$). Represent the number $$$n$$$ as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). In other words, you need to represent the given number $$$n$$$ as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case is a line containing an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^4$$$).OutputPrint $$$t$$$ answers to the test cases. Each answer must begin with an integer $$$k$$$ — the minimum number of summands. Next, $$$k$$$ terms must follow, each of which is a round number, and their sum is $$$n$$$. The terms can be printed in any order. If there are several answers, print any of them.ExampleInput
