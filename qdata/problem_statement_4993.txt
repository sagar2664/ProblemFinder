Some $$$(n-1)$$$ of the given $$$n$$$ rectangles have some common point. A point belongs to a rectangle if this point is strictly inside the rectangle or belongs to its boundary.Find any point with integer coordinates that belongs to at least $$$(n-1)$$$ given rectangles.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 132\,674$$$) — the number of given rectangles.Each the next $$$n$$$ lines contains four integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$ and $$$y_2$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le x_1 < x_2 \le 10^9$$$, $$$-10^9 \le y_1 < y_2 \le 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the bottom left and upper right corners of a rectangle.OutputPrint two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ — the coordinates of any point that belongs to at least $$$(n-1)$$$ given rectangles.ExamplesInput30 0 1 11 1 2 23 0 4 1Output1 1Input30 0 1 10 1 1 21 0 2 1Output1 1Input40 0 5 50 0 4 41 1 4 41 1 4 4Output1 1Input50 0 10 81 2 6 72 3 5 63 4 4 58 1 9 2Output3 4NoteThe picture below shows the rectangles in the first and second samples.
