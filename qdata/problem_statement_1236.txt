Maxminatime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ consisting only of zeroes and ones and an integer $$$k$$$. In one operation you can do one of the following:  Select $$$2$$$ consecutive elements of $$$a$$$ and replace them with their minimum (that is, let $$$a := [a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{i-1}, \min(a_{i}, a_{i+1}), a_{i+2}, \ldots, a_{n}]$$$ for some $$$1 \le i \le n-1$$$). This operation decreases the size of $$$a$$$ by $$$1$$$.  Select $$$k$$$ consecutive elements of $$$a$$$ and replace them with their maximum (that is, let $$$a := [a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{i-1}, \max(a_{i}, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_{i+k-1}), a_{i+k}, \ldots, a_{n}]$$$ for some $$$1 \le i \le n-k+1$$$). This operation decreases the size of $$$a$$$ by $$$k-1$$$. Determine if it's possible to turn $$$a$$$ into $$$[1]$$$ after several (possibly zero) operations.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le k \le n \le 50$$$), the size of array $$$a$$$ and the length of segments that you can perform second type operation on.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$$$ ($$$a_i$$$ is $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$), elements of array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, if it is possible to turn $$$a$$$ into $$$[1]$$$, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, you can perform the second type operation on second and third elements so $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[0, 1]$$$, then you can perform the second type operation on first and second elements, so $$$a$$$ turns to $$$[1]$$$.In the fourth test case, it's obvious to see that you can't make any $$$1$$$, no matter what you do.In the fifth test case, you can first perform a type 2 operation on the first three elements so that $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[1, 0, 0, 1]$$$, then perform a type 2 operation on the elements in positions two through four, so that $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[1, 1]$$$, and finally perform the first type operation on the remaining elements, so that $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[1]$$$.
