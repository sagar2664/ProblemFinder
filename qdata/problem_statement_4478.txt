C. Balanced Teamtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are a coach at your local university. There are $$$n$$$ students under your supervision, the programming skill of the $$$i$$$-th student is $$$a_i$$$.You have to create a team for a new programming competition. As you know, the more students some team has the more probable its victory is! So you have to create a team with the maximum number of students. But you also know that a team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in a created team should differ by no more than $$$5$$$.Your task is to report the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of students.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is a programming skill of the $$$i$$$-th student.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first example you can create a team with skills $$$[12, 17, 15]$$$.In the second example you can take all students in a team because their programming skills are equal.In the third example you can create a team consisting of a single student (and you cannot create a team consisting of at least two students).
