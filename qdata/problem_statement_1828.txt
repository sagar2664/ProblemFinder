B. Power Walkingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSam is a kindergartener, and there are $$$n$$$ children in his group. He decided to create a team with some of his children to play "brawl:go 2".Sam has $$$n$$$ power-ups, the $$$i$$$-th has type $$$a_i$$$. A child's strength is equal to the number of different types among power-ups he has.For a team of size $$$k$$$, Sam will distribute all $$$n$$$ power-ups to $$$k$$$ children in such a way that each of the $$$k$$$ children receives at least one power-up, and each power-up is given to someone.For each integer $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, find the minimum sum of strengths of a team of $$$k$$$ children Sam can get.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — types of Sam's power-ups.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor every test case print $$$n$$$ integers.The $$$k$$$-th integer should be equal to the minimum sum of strengths of children in the team of size $$$k$$$ that Sam can get.ExampleInput

NoteOne of the ways to give power-ups to minimise the sum of strengths in the first test case:   $$$k = 1: \{1, 1, 2\}$$$    $$$k = 2: \{1, 1\}, \{2\}$$$    $$$k = 3: \{1\}, \{1\}, \{2\}$$$   One of the ways to give power-ups to minimise the sum of strengths in the second test case:   $$$k = 1: \{1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5\}$$$    $$$k = 2: \{2, 2, 2, 4, 5\}, \{1\}$$$    $$$k = 3: \{2, 2, 2, 5\}, \{1\}, \{4\}$$$    $$$k = 4: \{2, 2, 2\}, \{1\}, \{4\}, \{5\}$$$    $$$k = 5: \{2, 2\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{4\}, \{5\}$$$    $$$k = 6: \{1\}, \{2\}, \{2\}, \{2\}, \{4\}, \{5\}$$$
