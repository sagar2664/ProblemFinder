Find a prime number $$$m$$$ such that $$$n + m$$$ is not prime.$$$^\dagger$$$ A prime number is a number with exactly $$$2$$$ factors. The first few prime numbers are $$$2,3,5,7,11,13,\ldots$$$. In particular, $$$1$$$ is not a prime number.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.The only line of each test case contains a prime number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a line containing a prime number $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq m \leq 10^5$$$) such that $$$n + m$$$ is not prime. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such $$$m$$$ always exists.If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them. ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$m = 2$$$, which is prime, and $$$n + m = 7 + 2 = 9$$$, which is not prime.In the second test case, $$$m = 7$$$, which is prime, and $$$n + m = 2 + 7 = 9$$$, which is not prime.In the third test case, $$$m = 47837$$$, which is prime, and $$$n + m = 75619 + 47837 = 123456$$$, which is not prime.
