Connect $$$x$$$ new vertices to this central vertex.  Connect $$$y$$$ new vertices to each of these $$$x$$$ vertices.  For example, below is a snowflake graph for $$$x=5$$$ and $$$y=3$$$.  The snowflake graph above has a central vertex $$$15$$$, then $$$x=5$$$ vertices attached to it ($$$3$$$, $$$6$$$, $$$7$$$, $$$8$$$, and $$$20$$$), and then $$$y=3$$$ vertices attached to each of those.  Given a snowflake graph, determine the values of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 200$$$; $$$1 \leq m \leq \min\left(1000, \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.The next $$$m$$$ lines each contain two integers each $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$, $$$u \neq v$$$) — the numbers of vertices connected by an edge. The graph does not contain multiple edges and self-loops.It is guaranteed that this graph is a snowflake graph for some integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ both greater than $$$1$$$.OutputFor each test case, on a separate line output the values of $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, in that order, separated by a space.ExampleInput

NoteThe first test case is pictured in the statement. Note that the output 3 5 is incorrect, since $$$x$$$ should be output before $$$y$$$.
