D. Letter Pickingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, they are given a non-empty string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string is even. Each player also has a string of their own, initially empty.Alice starts, then they alternate moves. In one move, a player takes either the first or the last letter of the string $$$s$$$, removes it from $$$s$$$ and prepends (adds to the beginning) it to their own string.The game ends when the string $$$s$$$ becomes empty. The winner is the player with a lexicographically smaller string. If the players' strings are equal, then it's a draw.A string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$b$$$ if there exists such position $$$i$$$ that $$$a_j = b_j$$$ for all $$$j < i$$$ and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.What is the result of the game if both players play optimally (e. g. both players try to win; if they can't, then try to draw)?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Each testcase consists of a single line — a non-empty string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string $$$s$$$ is even.The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$2000$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print the result of the game if both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice". If Bob wins, print "Bob". If it's a draw, print "Draw".ExampleInput

NoteOne of the possible games Alice and Bob can play in the first testcase:   Alice picks the first letter in $$$s$$$: $$$s=$$$"orces", $$$a=$$$"f", $$$b=$$$"";  Bob picks the last letter in $$$s$$$: $$$s=$$$"orce", $$$a=$$$"f", $$$b=$$$"s";  Alice picks the last letter in $$$s$$$: $$$s=$$$"orc", $$$a=$$$"ef", $$$b=$$$"s";  Bob picks the first letter in $$$s$$$: $$$s=$$$"rc", $$$a=$$$"ef", $$$b=$$$"os";  Alice picks the last letter in $$$s$$$: $$$s=$$$"r", $$$a=$$$"cef", $$$b=$$$"os";  Bob picks the remaining letter in $$$s$$$: $$$s=$$$"", $$$a=$$$"cef", $$$b=$$$"ros". Alice wins because "cef" < "ros". Neither of the players follows any strategy in this particular example game, so it doesn't show that Alice wins if both play optimally.
