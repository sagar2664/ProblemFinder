E. Anna and the Valentine's Day Gifttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSasha gave Anna a list $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make the first move. On her turn, Anna must choose an element $$$a_i$$$ from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of $$$42$$$, it would become $$$24$$$; if Anna chose the element with a value of $$$1580$$$, it would become $$$851$$$. Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change. On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ ($$$i \ne j$$$) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to $$$2007$$$ and $$$19$$$, he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer $$$200719$$$ or $$$192007$$$. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by $$$1$$$.Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e. after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this integer is not less than $$$10^m$$$ (i.e., $$$\ge 10^m$$$), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna wins.It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both players play optimally.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follows the description of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output:   "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play;  "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

NoteConsider the first test case.Anna can reverse the integer $$$2$$$, then Sasha can concatenate the integers $$$2$$$ and $$$14$$$, obtaining the integer $$$214$$$, which is greater than $$$10^2 = 100$$$. If Anna had reversed the integer $$$14$$$, Sasha would have concatenated the integers $$$41$$$ and $$$2$$$, obtaining the integer $$$412$$$, which is greater than $$$10^2 = 100$$$. Anna has no other possible moves, so she loses.
