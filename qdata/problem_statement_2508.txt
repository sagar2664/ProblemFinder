A. Tit for Tattime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, you can do at most $$$k$$$ operations of the following type on it:  choose $$$2$$$ different elements in the array, add $$$1$$$ to the first, and subtract $$$1$$$ from the second. However, all the elements of $$$a$$$ have to remain non-negative after this operation. What is lexicographically the smallest array you can obtain?An array $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $$$y$$$ if there exists an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$x_i<y_i$$$, and $$$x_j=y_j$$$ for all $$$1 \le j < i$$$. Less formally, at the first index $$$i$$$ in which they differ, $$$x_i<y_i$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 20$$$) – the number of test cases you need to solve.The first line of each test case contains $$$2$$$ integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10000$$$) — the number of elements in the array and the maximum number of operations you can make.The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$a_{n}$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 100$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the lexicographically smallest array you can obtain after at most $$$k$$$ operations.ExampleInput

NoteIn the second test case, we start by subtracting $$$1$$$ from the first element and adding $$$1$$$ to the second. Then, we can't get any lexicographically smaller arrays, because we can't make any of the elements negative.
