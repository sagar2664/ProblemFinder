A. Koxia and Whiteboardstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputKiyora has $$$n$$$ whiteboards numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th whiteboard has the integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it.Koxia performs $$$m$$$ operations. The $$$j$$$-th operation is to choose one of the whiteboards and change the integer written on it to $$$b_j$$$.Find the maximum possible sum of integers written on the whiteboards after performing all $$$m$$$ operations.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n,m \le 100$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).The third line of each test case contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible sum of integers written on whiteboards after performing all $$$m$$$ operations.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, Koxia can perform the operations as follows:  Choose the $$$1$$$-st whiteboard and rewrite the integer written on it to $$$b_1=4$$$.  Choose the $$$2$$$-nd whiteboard and rewrite to $$$b_2=5$$$. After performing all operations, the numbers on the three whiteboards are $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$ and $$$3$$$ respectively, and their sum is $$$12$$$. It can be proven that this is the maximum possible sum achievable.In the second test case, Koxia can perform the operations as follows:  Choose the $$$2$$$-nd whiteboard and rewrite to $$$b_1=3$$$.  Choose the $$$1$$$-st whiteboard and rewrite to $$$b_2=4$$$.  Choose the $$$2$$$-nd whiteboard and rewrite to $$$b_3=5$$$. The sum is $$$4 + 5 = 9$$$. It can be proven that this is the maximum possible sum achievable.
