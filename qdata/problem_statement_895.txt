E2. Unforgivable Curse (hard version)time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is a complex version of the problem. This version has no additional restrictions on the number $$$k$$$.The chief wizard of the Wizengamot once caught the evil wizard Drahyrt, but the evil wizard has returned and wants revenge on the chief wizard. So he stole spell $$$s$$$ from his student Harry.The spell — is a $$$n$$$-length string of lowercase Latin letters.Drahyrt wants to replace spell with an unforgivable curse — string $$$t$$$.Dragirt, using ancient magic, can swap letters at a distance $$$k$$$ or $$$k+1$$$ in spell as many times as he wants. In other words, Drahyrt can change letters in positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ in spell $$$s$$$ if $$$|i-j|=k$$$ or $$$|i-j|=k+1$$$.For example, if $$$k = 3, s = $$$ "talant" and $$$t = $$$ "atltna", Drahyrt can act as follows:  swap the letters at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$4$$$ to get spell "aaltnt".  swap the letters at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$6$$$ to get spell "atltna". You are given spells $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. Can Drahyrt change spell $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$?InputThe first line of input gives a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.Descriptions of the test cases are follow.The first line contains two integers $$$n, k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length spells and the number $$$k$$$ such that Drahyrt can change letters in a spell at a distance $$$k$$$ or $$$k+1$$$.The second line gives spell $$$s$$$ — a string of length $$$n$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.The third line gives spell $$$t$$$ — a string of length $$$n$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ values over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. Note that there is no limit on the sum of $$$k$$$ values over all test cases.OutputFor each test case, output on a separate line "YES" if Drahyrt can change spell $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ and "NO" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, lines "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as positive answer).ExampleInput

NoteThe first case is explained in the condition.In the second case, we can swap adjacent letters, so we can sort the string using bubble sorting, for example.In the third case, we can show that from the string $$$s$$$ we cannot get the string $$$t$$$ by swapping letters at a distance of $$$6$$$ or $$$7$$$.In the fourth case, for example, the following sequence of transformations is appropriate:  "accio" $$$\rightarrow$$$ "aocic" $$$\rightarrow$$$ "cocia" $$$\rightarrow$$$ "iocca" $$$\rightarrow$$$ "aocci" $$$\rightarrow$$$ "aicco" $$$\rightarrow$$$ "cicao" In the fifth case, we can show that it is impossible to get the string $$$s$$$ from the string $$$t$$$.In the sixth example, it is enough to swap the two outermost letters.
