F. Is It Flower?time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVlad found a flowerbed with graphs in his yard and decided to take one for himself. Later he found out that in addition to the usual graphs, $$$k$$$-flowers also grew on that flowerbed. A graph is called a $$$k$$$-flower if it consists of a simple cycle of length $$$k$$$, through each vertex of which passes its own simple cycle of length $$$k$$$ and these cycles do not intersect at the vertices. For example, $$$3$$$-flower looks like this:  Note that $$$1$$$-flower and $$$2$$$-flower do not exist, since at least $$$3$$$ vertices are needed to form a cycle.Vlad really liked the structure of the $$$k$$$-flowers and now he wants to find out if he was lucky to take one of them from the flowerbed.InputThe first line of input contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.The descriptions of the cases follow. An empty string is written before each case.The first line of each case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le m \le \min(2 \cdot 10^5, \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2})$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.The next $$$m$$$ lines contain two integers each $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$, $$$u \ne v$$$) — numbers of vertices connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the graph does not contain multiple edges and self-loops.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. It is also guaranteed for the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As an answer, output "YES" if Vlad's graph is a $$$k$$$-flower for some $$$k$$$, and "NO" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).ExamplesInput
