If there are multiple answers, then print any of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.The single line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the value $$$d$$$ in the first line, and $$$n$$$ integers in the second line — the permutation itself. If there are multiple answers, then print any of them.ExampleInput
