D. Progressions Coveringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two arrays: an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ zeros and an array $$$b$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.You can apply the following operation to the array $$$a$$$ an arbitrary number of times: choose some subsegment of $$$a$$$ of length $$$k$$$ and add the arithmetic progression $$$1, 2, \ldots, k$$$ to this subsegment — i. e. add $$$1$$$ to the first element of the subsegment, $$$2$$$ to the second element, and so on. The chosen subsegment should be inside the borders of the array $$$a$$$ (i.e., if the left border of the chosen subsegment is $$$l$$$, then the condition $$$1 \le l \le l + k - 1 \le n$$$ should be satisfied). Note that the progression added is always $$$1, 2, \ldots, k$$$ but not the $$$k, k - 1, \ldots, 1$$$ or anything else (i.e., the leftmost element of the subsegment always increases by $$$1$$$, the second element always increases by $$$2$$$ and so on).Your task is to find the minimum possible number of operations required to satisfy the condition $$$a_i \ge b_i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Note that the condition $$$a_i \ge b_i$$$ should be satisfied for all elements at once.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in both arrays and the length of the subsegment, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 10^{12}$$$), where $$$b_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the array $$$b$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum possible number of operations required to satisfy the condition $$$a_i \ge b_i$$$ for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.ExamplesInput

NoteConsider the first example. In this test, we don't really have any choice, so we need to add at least five progressions to make the first element equals $$$5$$$. The array $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[5, 10, 15]$$$.Consider the second example. In this test, let's add one progression on the segment $$$[1; 3]$$$ and two progressions on the segment $$$[4; 6]$$$. Then, the array $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6]$$$.
