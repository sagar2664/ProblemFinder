B. Vlad and Shapestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVladislav has a binary square grid of $$$n \times n$$$ cells. A triangle or a square is drawn on the grid with symbols $$$\texttt{1}$$$. As he is too busy being cool, he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid. A triangle is a shape consisting of $$$k$$$ ($$$k>1$$$) consecutive rows, where the $$$i$$$-th row has $$$2 \cdot i-1$$$ consecutive characters $$$\texttt{1}$$$, and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).  Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: $$$k=4$$$, $$$k=3$$$. The two right pictures don't contain triangles.  A square is a shape consisting of $$$k$$$ ($$$k>1$$$) consecutive rows, where the $$$i$$$-th row has $$$k$$$ consecutive characters $$$\texttt{1}$$$, which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.  Examples of two squares: $$$k=2$$$, $$$k=4$$$. For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 10$$$) — the size of the grid.The next $$$n$$$ lines each contain $$$n$$$ characters $$$\texttt{0}$$$ or $$$\texttt{1}$$$.The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the $$$\texttt{1}$$$s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle or square is greater than $$$1$$$ (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).OutputFor each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the $$$\texttt{1}$$$s in the grid form a square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).ExampleInput
