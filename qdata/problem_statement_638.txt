C. Strong Passwordtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp finally got the courage to register on ForceCoders. He came up with a handle but is still thinking about the password.He wants his password to be as strong as possible, so he came up with the following criteria:   the length of the password should be exactly $$$m$$$;  the password should only consist of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$;  the password should not appear in the password database (given as a string $$$s$$$) as a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous). Monocarp also came up with two strings of length $$$m$$$: $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both consisting only of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$. He wants the $$$i$$$-th digit of his password to be between $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$, inclusive.Does there exist a password that fits all criteria?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$), consisting only of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$ — the password database.The second line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 10$$$) — the required length of the password.The third line contains a string $$$l$$$ ($$$|l| = m$$$), consisting only of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$ — the lower restriction on each digit.The fourth line contains a string $$$r$$$ ($$$|r| = m$$$), consisting only of digits from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$ — the upper restriction on each digit. $$$l_i \le r_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$.The sum of lengths of $$$s$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a password that fits all criteria. Print "NO" otherwise.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase, Monocarp can choose password "50". It doesn't appear in $$$s$$$ as a subsequence.In the second testcase, all combinations of three digits, each of them being from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$, fit the criteria on $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. However, all of them appear in $$$s$$$ as subsequences. For example, "314" appears at positions $$$[3, 5, 12]$$$ and "222" appears at positions $$$[2, 6, 10]$$$.In the third testcase, Monocarp can choose password "4321". Actually, that is the only password that fits the criteria on $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Luckily, it doesn't appear in $$$s$$$ as a subsequence.In the fourth testcase, only "49" and "59" fit the criteria on $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Both of them appear in $$$s$$$ as subsequences.In the fifth testcase, Monocarp can choose password "11".
