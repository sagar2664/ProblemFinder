Then you decided to perform the following actions:   If there exists a triple of vertices $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ of $$$H$$$, such that there is an edge from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ and an edge from $$$b$$$ to $$$c$$$, but there is no edge from $$$a$$$ to $$$c$$$, add an edge from $$$a$$$ to $$$c$$$.  Repeat the previous step as long as there are such triples. Note that the number of edges in $$$H$$$ can be up to $$$n^2$$$ after performing the actions.You also wrote some values on vertices of graph $$$H$$$. More precisely, vertex $$$i$$$ has the value of $$$a_i$$$ written on it.Consider a simple path consisting of $$$k$$$ distinct vertices with indexes $$$v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$$$. The length of such a path is $$$k$$$. The value of that path is defined as $$$\sum_{i = 1}^k a_{v_i}$$$.A simple path is considered the longest if there is no other simple path in the graph with greater length.Among all the longest simple paths in $$$H$$$, find the one with the smallest value.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n,m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the vertices of graph $$$H$$$.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v_i$$$ and $$$u_i$$$ ($$$1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$$$) — meaning that there is an edge going from vertex $$$v_i$$$ to vertex $$$u_i$$$ in graph $$$G$$$. Note that edges are directed. Also note that the graph may have self-loops and multiple edges.It is guaranteed that neither the sum of $$$n$$$ nor the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases exceeds $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output two numbers — the length of the longest simple path in $$$H$$$ and the minimal possible value of such path.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the longest path in both graphs is $$$1 \to 3 \to 4 \to 5 \to 2$$$. As the path includes all vertices, the minimal possible value of the longest path is the sum of values on all vertices, which is $$$12$$$.In the second test case, the longest possible path is $$$1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 4 \to 6 \to 7$$$. As there are no longest paths with vertex $$$5$$$ in them, this path has the minimal possible value of $$$5\,999\,999\,995$$$.In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no path longer than $$$11$$$ and that the value of the longest path cannot be less than $$$37$$$. Also, notice that the given graph has both self-loops and multiple edges.
