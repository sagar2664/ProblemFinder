A. Perfectly Imperfect Arraytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, tell us whether it has a non-empty subsequence such that the product of its elements is not a perfect square.A sequence $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by deleting some (possibly zero) elements.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$a_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^4$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputIf there's a subsequence of $$$a$$$ whose product isn't a perfect square, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".ExampleInput

NoteIn the first example, the product of the whole array ($$$20$$$) isn't a perfect square.In the second example, all subsequences have a perfect square product.
