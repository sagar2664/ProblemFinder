A. Cipher Shifertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a string $$$a$$$ (unknown to you), consisting of lowercase Latin letters, encrypted according to the following rule into string $$$s$$$:  after each character of string $$$a$$$, an arbitrary (possibly zero) number of any lowercase Latin letters, different from the character itself, is added;  after each such addition, the character that we supplemented is added. You are given string $$$s$$$, and you need to output the initial string $$$a$$$. In other words, you need to decrypt string $$$s$$$.Note that each string encrypted in this way is decrypted uniquely.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 100$$$) — the length of the encrypted message.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ — the encrypted message obtained from some string $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the decrypted message $$$a$$$ on a separate line.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first encrypted message, the letter $$$a$$$ is encrypted as $$$aba$$$, and the letter $$$c$$$ is encrypted as $$$cabac$$$.In the second encrypted message, only one letter $$$q$$$ is encrypted as $$$qzxcq$$$.In the third encrypted message, zero characters are added to each letter.
