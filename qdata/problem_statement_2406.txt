Lost Treetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is an interactive problem.Little Dormi was faced with an awkward problem at the carnival: he has to guess the edges of an unweighted tree of $$$n$$$ nodes! The nodes of the tree are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.The game master only allows him to ask one type of question: Little Dormi picks a node $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le r \le n$$$), and the game master will reply with an array $$$d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n$$$, where $$$d_i$$$ is the length of the shortest path from node $$$r$$$ to $$$i$$$, for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$.Additionally, to make the game unfair challenge Little Dormi the game master will allow at most $$$\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$$$ questions, where $$$\lceil x \rceil$$$ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to $$$x$$$.Faced with the stomach-churning possibility of not being able to guess the tree, Little Dormi needs your help to devise a winning strategy!Note that the game master creates the tree before the game starts, and does not change it during the game.InputThe first line of input contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2\,000$$$), the number of nodes in the tree.You will then begin interaction.OutputWhen your program has found the tree, first output a line consisting of a single "!" followed by $$$n-1$$$ lines each with two space separated integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, denoting an edge connecting nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le n$$$). Once you are done, terminate your program normally immediately after flushing the output stream.You may output the edges in any order and an edge $$$(a,b)$$$ is considered the same as an edge $$$(b,a)$$$. Answering is not considered as a query.InteractionAfter taking input, you may make at most $$$\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$$$ queries. Each query is made in the format "? r", where $$$r$$$ is an integer $$$1 \le r \le n$$$ that denotes the node you want to pick for that query.You will then receive $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n$$$, where $$$d_i$$$ is the length of the shortest path from node $$$r$$$ to $$$i$$$, followed by a newline.After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:  fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;  System.out.flush() in Java;  flush(output) in Pascal;  stdout.flush() in Python;  see documentation for other languages. If at any point you make an invalid query or try to make more than $$$\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$$$ queries, the interaction will terminate immediately and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.HacksTo hack a solution, use the following format.The first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2\,000$$$).The next $$$n−1$$$ lines contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u,v \le n$$$) denoting an edge between $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$u \neq v$$$). These $$$n-1$$$ edges must form a tree.ExamplesInput

NoteHere is the tree from the first example.  Notice that the edges can be output in any order.Additionally, here are the answers for querying every single node in example $$$1$$$: $$$1$$$: $$$[0,1,2,2]$$$  $$$2$$$: $$$[1,0,1,1]$$$  $$$3$$$: $$$[2,1,0,2]$$$  $$$4$$$: $$$[2,1,2,0]$$$Below is the tree from the second example interaction.  Lastly, here are the answers for querying every single node in example $$$2$$$: $$$1$$$: $$$[0,4,1,3,2]$$$  $$$2$$$: $$$[4,0,3,1,2]$$$  $$$3$$$: $$$[1,3,0,2,1]$$$  $$$4$$$: $$$[3,1,2,0,1]$$$  $$$5$$$: $$$[2,2,1,1,0]$$$
