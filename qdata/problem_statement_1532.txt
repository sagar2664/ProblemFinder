C. Fishingprince Plays With Arraytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFishingprince is playing with an array $$$[a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n]$$$. He also has a magic number $$$m$$$.He can do the following two operations on it:  Select $$$1\le i\le n$$$ such that $$$a_i$$$ is divisible by $$$m$$$ (that is, there exists an integer $$$t$$$ such that $$$m \cdot t = a_i$$$). Replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$m$$$ copies of $$$\frac{a_i}{m}$$$. The order of the other elements doesn't change. For example, when $$$m=2$$$ and $$$a=[2,3]$$$ and $$$i=1$$$, $$$a$$$ changes into $$$[1,1,3]$$$.  Select $$$1\le i\le n-m+1$$$ such that $$$a_i=a_{i+1}=\dots=a_{i+m-1}$$$. Replace these $$$m$$$ elements with a single $$$m \cdot a_i$$$. The order of the other elements doesn't change. For example, when $$$m=2$$$ and $$$a=[3,2,2,3]$$$ and $$$i=2$$$, $$$a$$$ changes into $$$[3,4,3]$$$. Note that the array length might change during the process. The value of $$$n$$$ above is defined as the current length of the array (might differ from the $$$n$$$ in the input).Fishingprince has another array $$$[b_1,b_2,\dots,b_k]$$$. Please determine if he can turn $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$ using any number (possibly zero) of operations.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 5\cdot 10^4$$$, $$$2\le m\le 10^9$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le 10^9$$$).The third line of each test case contains one integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1\le k\le 5\cdot 10^4$$$).The fourth line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k$$$ ($$$1\le b_i\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n+k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print Yes if it is possible to turn $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$, and No otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case of the sample, we can do the second operation with $$$i=2$$$: $$$[1,\color{red}{2,2},4,2]\to [1,\color{red}{4},4,2]$$$.In the second testcase of the sample, we can:  do the second operation with $$$i=2$$$: $$$[1,\color{red}{2,2},8,2,2]\to [1,\color{red}{4},8,2,2]$$$.  do the second operation with $$$i=4$$$: $$$[1,4,8,\color{red}{2,2}]\to [1,4,8,\color{red}{4}]$$$.  do the first operation with $$$i=3$$$: $$$[1,4,\color{red}{8},4]\to [1,4,\color{red}{4,4},4]$$$.  do the second operation with $$$i=2$$$: $$$[1,\color{red}{4,4},4,4]\to [1,\color{red}{8},4,4]$$$.  do the second operation with $$$i=3$$$: $$$[1,8,\color{red}{4,4}]\to [1,8,\color{red}{8}]$$$.  do the second operation with $$$i=2$$$: $$$[1,\color{red}{8,8}]\to [1,\color{red}{16}]$$$.
