E. 2..3...4.... Wonderful! Wonderful!time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputStack has an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that $$$a_i = i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$). He will select a positive integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor$$$) and do the following operation on $$$a$$$ any number (possibly $$$0$$$) of times.  Select a subsequence$$$^\dagger$$$ $$$s$$$ of length $$$2 \cdot k + 1$$$ from $$$a$$$. Now, he will delete the first $$$k$$$ elements of $$$s$$$ from $$$a$$$. To keep things perfectly balanced (as all things should be), he will also delete the last $$$k$$$ elements of $$$s$$$ from $$$a$$$. Stack wonders how many arrays $$$a$$$ can he end up with for each $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor$$$). As Stack is weak at counting problems, he needs your help. Since the number of arrays might be too large, please print it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.$$$^\dagger$$$ A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deleting several (possibly, zero or all) elements. For example, $$$[1, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$ and $$$[2, 3]$$$ are subsequences of $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$. On the other hand, $$$[3, 1]$$$ and $$$[2, 1, 3]$$$ are not subsequences of $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 10^6$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test, on a new line, print $$$\lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor$$$ space-separated integers — the $$$i$$$-th integer representing the number of arrays modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$ that Stack can get if he selects $$$k=i$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, two $$$a$$$ are possible for $$$k=1$$$:   $$$[1,2,3]$$$;  $$$[2]$$$. In the second test case, four $$$a$$$ are possible for $$$k=1$$$:   $$$[1,2,3,4]$$$;  $$$[1,3]$$$;  $$$[2,3]$$$;  $$$[2,4]$$$. In the third test case, two $$$a$$$ are possible for $$$k=2$$$:   $$$[1,2,3,4,5]$$$;  $$$[3]$$$.
