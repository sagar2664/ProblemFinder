D. Problemsolving Marathontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPolycarp has decided to do a problemsolving marathon. He wants to solve $$$s$$$ problems in $$$n$$$ days. Let $$$a_i$$$ be the number of problems he solves during the $$$i$$$-th day. He wants to find a distribution of problems into days such that:   $$$a_i$$$ is an integer value for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$;  $$$a_i \ge 1$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$;  $$$a_{i + 1} \ge a_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$;  $$$a_{i + 1} \le 2 \cdot a_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$;  $$$a_n$$$ is maximized. Note that $$$a_1$$$ can be arbitrarily large.What is the largest value of $$$a_n$$$ Polycarp can obtain?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of testcases.Then the descriptions of $$$t$$$ testcases follow.The only line of each testcase contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le s \le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of days and the number of problems Polycarp wants to solve.It's guaranteed that the distribution always exists within the given constraints.OutputFor each testcase print a single integer — the maximum value of $$$a_n$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase there is only one distribution: $$$[15]$$$.In the second testcase the distribution that maximizes $$$a_n$$$ is: $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$.In the third testcase the distribution that maximizes $$$a_n$$$ is: $$$[2, 4]$$$. $$$[3, 3]$$$ is a valid distribution but $$$a_n=3$$$ which is smaller than $$$4$$$. $$$[1, 5]$$$ is not a valid distribution because $$$5 > 2 \cdot 1$$$.
