Two subsequences are considered different if index sets of numbers included in them are different. That is, the values ​of the elements ​do not matter in the comparison of subsequences. In particular, the array $$$a$$$ has exactly $$$2^n - 1$$$ different subsequences (excluding an empty subsequence).InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100\,000$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The next line contains integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^6$$$).OutputPrint exactly one integer — the number of good subsequences taken modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExamplesInput21 2Output3Input52 2 1 22 14Output13NoteIn the first example, all three non-empty possible subsequences are good: $$$\{1\}$$$, $$$\{1, 2\}$$$, $$$\{2\}$$$In the second example, the possible good subsequences are: $$$\{2\}$$$, $$$\{2, 2\}$$$, $$$\{2, 22\}$$$, $$$\{2, 14\}$$$, $$$\{2\}$$$, $$$\{2, 22\}$$$, $$$\{2, 14\}$$$, $$$\{1\}$$$, $$$\{1, 22\}$$$, $$$\{1, 14\}$$$, $$$\{22\}$$$, $$$\{22, 14\}$$$, $$$\{14\}$$$.Note, that some subsequences are listed more than once, since they occur in the original array multiple times.
