C. Flexible Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have a string $$$a$$$ and a string $$$b$$$. Both of the strings have length $$$n$$$. There are at most $$$10$$$ different characters in the string $$$a$$$. You also have a set $$$Q$$$. Initially, the set $$$Q$$$ is empty. You can apply the following operation on the string $$$a$$$ any number of times:  Choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\leq i \leq n$$$) and a lowercase English letter $$$c$$$. Add $$$a_i$$$ to the set $$$Q$$$ and then replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$c$$$. For example, Let the string $$$a$$$ be "$$$\tt{abecca}$$$". We can do the following operations:   In the first operation, if you choose $$$i = 3$$$ and $$$c = \tt{x}$$$, the character $$$a_3 = \tt{e}$$$ will be added to the set $$$Q$$$. So, the set $$$Q$$$ will be $$$\{\tt{e}\}$$$, and the string $$$a$$$ will be "$$$\tt{ab\underline{x}cca}$$$". In the second operation, if you choose $$$i = 6$$$ and $$$c = \tt{s}$$$, the character $$$a_6 = \tt{a}$$$ will be added to the set $$$Q$$$. So, the set $$$Q$$$ will be $$$\{\tt{e}, \tt{a}\}$$$, and the string $$$a$$$ will be "$$$\tt{abxcc\underline{s}}$$$". You can apply any number of operations on $$$a$$$, but in the end, the set $$$Q$$$ should contain at most $$$k$$$ different characters. Under this constraint, you have to maximize the number of integer pairs $$$(l, r)$$$ ($$$1\leq l\leq r \leq n$$$) such that $$$a[l,r] = b[l,r]$$$. Here, $$$s[l,r]$$$ means the substring of string $$$s$$$ starting at index $$$l$$$ (inclusively) and ending at index $$$r$$$ (inclusively).InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$0\leq k\leq 10$$$) — the length of the two strings and the limit on different characters in the set $$$Q$$$. The second line contains the string $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. There is at most $$$10$$$ different characters in the string $$$a$$$.The last line contains the string $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Both of the strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ contain only lowercase English letters. The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer in a line, the maximum number of pairs $$$(l, r)$$$ satisfying the constraints.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first case, we can select index $$$i = 3$$$ and replace it with character $$$c = \tt{d}$$$. All possible pairs $$$(l,r)$$$ will be valid.In the second case, we can't perform any operation. The $$$3$$$ valid pairs $$$(l,r)$$$ are:   $$$a[1,1] = b[1,1] =$$$ "$$$\tt{a}$$$",  $$$a[1,2] = b[1,2] =$$$ "$$$\tt{ab}$$$",  $$$a[2,2] = b[2,2] =$$$ "$$$\tt{b}$$$". In the third case, we can choose index $$$2$$$ and index $$$3$$$ and replace them with the characters $$$\tt{c}$$$ and $$$\tt{d}$$$ respectively. The final set $$$Q$$$ will be $$$\{\tt{b}\}$$$ having size $$$1$$$ that satisfies the value of $$$k$$$. All possible pairs $$$(l,r)$$$ will be valid.
