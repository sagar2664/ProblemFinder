B. Points on Planetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a two-dimensional plane, and you need to place $$$n$$$ chips on it. You can place a chip only at a point with integer coordinates. The cost of placing a chip at the point $$$(x, y)$$$ is equal to $$$|x| + |y|$$$ (where $$$|a|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$a$$$).The cost of placing $$$n$$$ chips is equal to the maximum among the costs of each chip.You need to place $$$n$$$ chips on the plane in such a way that the Euclidean distance between each pair of chips is strictly greater than $$$1$$$, and the cost is the minimum possible.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Next $$$t$$$ cases follow.The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of chips you need to place.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum cost to place $$$n$$$ chips if the distance between each pair of chips must be strictly greater than $$$1$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, you can place the only chip at point $$$(0, 0)$$$ with total cost equal to $$$0 + 0 = 0$$$.In the second test case, you can, for example, place chips at points $$$(-1, 0)$$$, $$$(0, 1)$$$ and $$$(1, 0)$$$ with costs $$$|-1| + |0| = 1$$$, $$$|0| + |1| = 1$$$ and $$$|0| + |1| = 1$$$. Distance between each pair of chips is greater than $$$1$$$ (for example, distance between $$$(-1, 0)$$$ and $$$(0, 1)$$$ is equal to $$$\sqrt{2}$$$). The total cost is equal to $$$\max(1, 1, 1) = 1$$$.In the third test case, you can, for example, place chips at points $$$(-1, -1)$$$, $$$(-1, 1)$$$, $$$(1, 1)$$$, $$$(0, 0)$$$ and $$$(0, 2)$$$. The total cost is equal to $$$\max(2, 2, 2, 0, 2) = 2$$$.
