D2. Beautiful Bracket Sequence (hard version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the hard version of this problem. The only difference is the limit of $$$n$$$ - the length of the input string. In this version, $$$1 \leq n \leq 10^6$$$.Let's define a correct bracket sequence and its depth as follow:  An empty string is a correct bracket sequence with depth $$$0$$$.  If "s" is a correct bracket sequence with depth $$$d$$$ then "(s)" is a correct bracket sequence with depth $$$d + 1$$$.  If "s" and "t" are both correct bracket sequences then their concatenation "st" is a correct bracket sequence with depth equal to the maximum depth of $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. For a (not necessarily correct) bracket sequence $$$s$$$, we define its depth as the maximum depth of any correct bracket sequence induced by removing some characters from $$$s$$$ (possibly zero). For example: the bracket sequence $$$s = $$$"())(())" has depth $$$2$$$, because by removing the third character we obtain a correct bracket sequence "()(())" with depth $$$2$$$.Given a string $$$a$$$ consists of only characters '(', ')' and '?'. Consider all (not necessarily correct) bracket sequences obtained by replacing all characters '?' in $$$a$$$ by either '(' or ')'. Calculate the sum of all the depths of all these bracket sequences. As this number can be large, find it modulo $$$998244353$$$.Hacks in this problem can be done only if easy and hard versions of this problem was solved.InputThe only line contains a non-empty string consist of only '(', ')' and '?'. The length of the string is at most $$$10^6$$$.OutputPrint the answer modulo $$$998244353$$$ in a single line.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first test case, we can obtain $$$4$$$ bracket sequences by replacing all characters '?' with either '(' or ')':  "((". Its depth is $$$0$$$;  "))". Its depth is $$$0$$$;  ")(". Its depth is $$$0$$$;  "()". Its depth is $$$1$$$. So, the answer is $$$1 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1$$$.In the second test case, we can obtain $$$4$$$ bracket sequences by replacing all characters '?' with either '(' or ')':  "(((())". Its depth is $$$2$$$;  "()()))". Its depth is $$$2$$$;  "((()))". Its depth is $$$3$$$;  "()(())". Its depth is $$$2$$$. So, the answer is $$$9 = 2 + 2 + 3 + 2$$$.
