C. Complementary XORtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have two binary strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You would like to make all the elements of both strings equal to $$$0$$$. Unfortunately, you can modify the contents of these strings using only the following operation:  You choose two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$);  For every $$$i$$$ that respects $$$l \le i \le r$$$, change $$$a_i$$$ to the opposite. That is, $$$a_i := 1 - a_i$$$;  For every $$$i$$$ that respects either $$$1 \le i < l$$$ or $$$r < i \le n$$$, change $$$b_i$$$ to the opposite. That is, $$$b_i := 1 - b_i$$$. Your task is to determine if this is possible, and if it is, to find such an appropriate chain of operations. The number of operations should not exceed $$$n + 5$$$. It can be proven that if such chain of operations exists, one exists with at most $$$n + 5$$$ operations. InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the strings.The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$a$$$, consisting only of characters 0 and 1, of length $$$n$$$.The third line of each test case contains a binary string $$$b$$$, consisting only of characters 0 and 1, of length $$$n$$$.It is guaranteed that sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print first "YES" if it's possible to make all the elements of both strings equal to $$$0$$$. Otherwise, print "NO". If the answer is "YES", on the next line print a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \le k \le n + 5$$$) — the number of operations. Then $$$k$$$ lines follows, each contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) — the description of the operation.If there are several correct answers, print any of them.ExampleInput

2 3NoteIn the first test case, we can perform one operation with $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 2$$$. So $$$a_2 := 1 - 1 = 0$$$ and string $$$a$$$ became equal to 000. $$$b_1 := 1 - 1 = 0$$$, $$$b_3 := 1 - 1 = 0$$$ and string $$$b$$$ became equal to 000.In the second and in the third test cases, it can be proven that it's impossible to make all elements of both strings equal to $$$0$$$.In the fourth test case, we can perform an operation with $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 2$$$, then string $$$a$$$ became equal to 01, and string $$$b$$$ doesn't change. Then we perform an operation with $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 2$$$, then $$$a_2 := 1 - 1 = 0$$$ and $$$b_1 = 1 - 1 = 0$$$. So both of string $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ became equal to 00.In the fifth test case, we can perform an operation with $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 1$$$. Then string $$$a$$$ became equal to 011 and string $$$b$$$ became equal to 100. Then we can perform an operation with $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 3$$$, so both of string $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ became equal to 000.
