E. Swap and Taketime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou're given an array consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. You have to perform $$$n$$$ turns.Initially your score is $$$0$$$.On the $$$i$$$-th turn, you are allowed to leave the array as it is or swap any one pair of $$$2$$$ adjacent elements in the array and change exactly one of them to $$$0$$$(and leave the value of other element unchanged) after swapping. In either case(whether you swap or not), after this you add $$$a_i$$$ to your score. What's the maximum possible score you can get?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 500$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^6$$$).OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum possible score.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first example, to get the maximum score we do as follows. Do nothing on the first turn, add $$$3$$$ to the score. Swap the first and the second elements and turn $$$1$$$ to $$$0$$$ on the second turn, and add $$$3$$$ to the score. The final score is $$$6$$$.
