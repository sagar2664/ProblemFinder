D. New Year's Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVlad has $$$n$$$ friends, for each of whom he wants to buy one gift for the New Year.There are $$$m$$$ shops in the city, in each of which he can buy a gift for any of his friends. If the $$$j$$$-th friend ($$$1 \le j \le n$$$) receives a gift bought in the shop with the number $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le m$$$), then the friend receives $$$p_{ij}$$$ units of joy. The rectangular table $$$p_{ij}$$$ is given in the input.Vlad has time to visit at most $$$n-1$$$ shops (where $$$n$$$ is the number of friends). He chooses which shops he will visit and for which friends he will buy gifts in each of them.Let the $$$j$$$-th friend receive $$$a_j$$$ units of joy from Vlad's gift. Let's find the value $$$\alpha=\min\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$$$. Vlad's goal is to buy gifts so that the value of $$$\alpha$$$ is as large as possible. In other words, Vlad wants to maximize the minimum of the joys of his friends.For example, let $$$m = 2$$$, $$$n = 2$$$. Let the joy from the gifts that we can buy in the first shop: $$$p_{11} = 1$$$, $$$p_{12}=2$$$, in the second shop: $$$p_{21} = 3$$$, $$$p_{22}=4$$$.Then it is enough for Vlad to go only to the second shop and buy a gift for the first friend, bringing joy $$$3$$$, and for the second — bringing joy $$$4$$$. In this case, the value $$$\alpha$$$ will be equal to $$$\min\{3, 4\} = 3$$$Help Vlad choose gifts for his friends so that the value of $$$\alpha$$$ is as high as possible. Please note that each friend must receive one gift. Vlad can visit at most $$$n-1$$$ shops (where $$$n$$$ is the number of friends). In the shop, he can buy any number of gifts.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the input.An empty line is written before each test case. Then there is a line containing integers $$$m$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n$$$, $$$2 \le n \cdot m \le 10^5$$$) separated by a space — the number of shops and the number of friends, where $$$n \cdot m$$$ is the product of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$.Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, each containing $$$n$$$ numbers. The number in the $$$i$$$-th row of the $$$j$$$-th column $$$p_{ij}$$$ ($$$1 \le p_{ij} \le 10^9$$$) is the joy of the product intended for friend number $$$j$$$ in shop number $$$i$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases in the test does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$t$$$ lines, each line must contain the answer to the corresponding test case — the maximum possible value of $$$\alpha$$$, where $$$\alpha$$$ is the minimum of the joys from a gift for all of Vlad's friends.ExampleInput
