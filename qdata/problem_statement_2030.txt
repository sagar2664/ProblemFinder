E. William The Oblivious time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output  Before becoming a successful trader William got a university degree. During his education an interesting situation happened, after which William started to listen to homework assignments much more attentively. What follows is a formal description of the homework assignment as William heard it:You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ only consisting of characters "a", "b" and "c". There are $$$q$$$ queries of format ($$$pos, c$$$), meaning replacing the element of string $$$s$$$ at position $$$pos$$$ with character $$$c$$$. After each query you must output the minimal number of characters in the string, which have to be replaced, so that the string doesn't contain string "abc" as a subsequence. A valid replacement of a character is replacing it with "a", "b" or "c".A string $$$x$$$ is said to be a subsequence of string $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ $$$(1 \le n, q \le 10^5)$$$, the length of the string and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of characters "a", "b" and "c".Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains an integer $$$i$$$ and character $$$c$$$ $$$(1 \le i \le n)$$$, index and the value of the new item in the string, respectively. It is guaranteed that character's $$$c$$$ value is "a", "b" or "c".OutputFor each query output the minimal number of characters that would have to be replaced so that the string doesn't contain "abc" as a subsequence.ExampleInput

NoteLet's consider the state of the string after each query:   $$$s = $$$"aaaaccccc". In this case the string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence and no replacements are needed. $$$s = $$$"aaabccccc". In this case 1 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$"aaaaccccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence. $$$s = $$$"ababccccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$aaaaccccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence. $$$s = $$$"ababacccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$"aaaaacccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence. $$$s = $$$"bbabacccc". In this case 1 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$"bbacacccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence. $$$s = $$$"bbababccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$"bbacacccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence. $$$s = $$$"bbabcbccc". In this case 1 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$"bbcbcbccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence. $$$s = $$$"baabcbccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$"bbbbcbccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence. $$$s = $$$"aaabcbccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$"aaacccccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence. $$$s = $$$"aaababccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$"aaacacccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence. $$$s = $$$"aaababccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$"aaacacccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence. $$$s = $$$"aaababbcc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $$$s = $$$"aaababbbb". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
