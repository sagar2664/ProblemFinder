B. Getting Zerotime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSuppose you have an integer $$$v$$$. In one operation, you can:   either set $$$v = (v + 1) \bmod 32768$$$  or set $$$v = (2 \cdot v) \bmod 32768$$$. You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. What is the minimum number of operations you need to make each $$$a_i$$$ equal to $$$0$$$?InputThe first line contains the single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 32768$$$) — the number of integers.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i < 32768$$$).OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be equal to the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a_i$$$ equal to $$$0$$$.ExampleInput

Output
14 4 4 15 NoteLet's consider each $$$a_i$$$:   $$$a_1 = 19$$$. You can, firstly, increase it by one to get $$$20$$$ and then multiply it by two $$$13$$$ times. You'll get $$$0$$$ in $$$1 + 13 = 14$$$ steps.  $$$a_2 = 32764$$$. You can increase it by one $$$4$$$ times: $$$32764 \rightarrow 32765 \rightarrow 32766 \rightarrow 32767 \rightarrow 0$$$.  $$$a_3 = 10240$$$. You can multiply it by two $$$4$$$ times: $$$10240 \rightarrow 20480 \rightarrow 8192 \rightarrow 16384 \rightarrow 0$$$.  $$$a_4 = 49$$$. You can multiply it by two $$$15$$$ times.
