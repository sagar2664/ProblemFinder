D. Prefixes and Suffixestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have two strings $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:   Choose a positive integer $$$1 \leq k \leq n$$$.  Swap the prefix of the string $$$s_1$$$ and the suffix of the string $$$s_2$$$ of length $$$k$$$. Is it possible to make these two strings equal by doing described operations?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.Each test case consists of three lines.The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the strings $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$. The second line contains the string $$$s_1$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters.The third line contains the string $$$s_2$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make the strings equal, and "NO" otherwise.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case:  Initially $$$s_1 = \mathtt{cbc}$$$, $$$s_2 = \mathtt{aba}$$$.  Operation with $$$k = 1$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \mathtt{abc}$$$, $$$s_2 = \mathtt{abc}$$$. In the second test case:  Initially $$$s_1 = \mathtt{abcaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \mathtt{cbabb}$$$.  Operation with $$$k = 2$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \mathtt{bbcaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \mathtt{cbaab}$$$.  Operation with $$$k = 3$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \mathtt{aabaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \mathtt{cbbbc}$$$.  Operation with $$$k = 1$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \mathtt{cabaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \mathtt{cbbba}$$$.  Operation with $$$k = 2$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \mathtt{babaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \mathtt{cbbca}$$$.  Operation with $$$k = 1$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \mathtt{aabaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \mathtt{cbbcb}$$$.  Operation with $$$k = 2$$$, after the operation $$$s_1 = \mathtt{cbbaa}$$$, $$$s_2 = \mathtt{cbbaa}$$$. In the third test case, it's impossible to make strings equal.
