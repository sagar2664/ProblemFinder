C. Assembly via Minimumstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSasha has an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers. He got bored and for all $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$i < j$$$), he wrote down the minimum value of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$. He obtained a new array $$$b$$$ of size $$$\frac{n\cdot (n-1)}{2}$$$.For example, if $$$a=$$$ [$$$2,3,5,1$$$], he would write [$$$\min(2, 3), \min(2, 5), \min(2, 1), \min(3, 5), \min(3, 1), min(5, 1)$$$] $$$=$$$ [$$$2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1$$$].Then, he randomly shuffled all the elements of the array $$$b$$$.Unfortunately, he forgot the array $$$a$$$, and your task is to restore any possible array $$$a$$$ from which the array $$$b$$$ could have been obtained.The elements of array $$$a$$$ should be in the range $$$[-10^9,10^9]$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 200$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 10^3$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$\frac{n\cdot (n-1)}{2}$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\dots,b_{\frac{n\cdot (n-1)}{2}}$$$ ($$$−10^9\le b_i\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of array $$$b$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all tests does not exceed $$$10^3$$$ and for each array $$$b$$$ in the test, there exists an original array.OutputFor each test case, output any possible array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.ExampleInput

Another suitable array could be $$$[15,10]$$$.
