B. Partial Replacementtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a number $$$k$$$ and a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters '.' and '*'. You want to replace some of the '*' characters with 'x' characters so that the following conditions are met:   The first character '*' in the original string should be replaced with 'x';  The last character '*' in the original string should be replaced with 'x';  The distance between two neighboring replaced characters 'x' must not exceed $$$k$$$ (more formally, if you replaced characters at positions $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i < j$$$) and at positions $$$[i+1, j-1]$$$ there is no "x" symbol, then $$$j-i$$$ must be no more than $$$k$$$). For example, if $$$n=7$$$, $$$s=$$$.**.*** and $$$k=3$$$, then the following strings will satisfy the conditions above:   .xx.*xx;  .x*.x*x;  .xx.xxx.  But, for example, the following strings will not meet the conditions:   .**.*xx (the first character '*' should be replaced with 'x');  .x*.xx* (the last character '*' should be replaced with 'x');  .x*.*xx (the distance between characters at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$6$$$ is greater than $$$k=3$$$). Given $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$s$$$, find the minimum number of '*' characters that must be replaced with 'x' in order to meet the above conditions.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 50$$$).The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of the characters '.' and '*'.It is guaranteed that there is at least one '*' in the string $$$s$$$.It is guaranteed that the distance between any two neighboring '*' characters does not exceed $$$k$$$.OutputFor each test case output the minimum number of '*' characters that must be replaced with 'x' characters in order to satisfy the conditions above.ExampleInput
