A1. Generate state |00⟩ + |01⟩ + |10⟩time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two qubits in state $$$|00 \rangle$$$. Your task is to create the following state on them:$$$$$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \big( |00 \rangle + |01 \rangle + |10 \rangle)$$$$$$You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 2 qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubits.Your code should have the following signature:namespace Solution {    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Unit {        // your code here    }}
