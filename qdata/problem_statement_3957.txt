E. Another Filling the Gridtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have $$$n \times n$$$ square grid and an integer $$$k$$$. Put an integer in each cell while satisfying the conditions below.  All numbers in the grid should be between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ inclusive.  Minimum number of the $$$i$$$-th row is $$$1$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$).  Minimum number of the $$$j$$$-th column is $$$1$$$ ($$$1 \le j \le n$$$). Find the number of ways to put integers in the grid. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo $$$(10^{9} + 7)$$$.  These are the examples of valid and invalid grid when $$$n=k=2$$$. InputThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 250$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10^{9}$$$).OutputPrint the answer modulo $$$(10^{9} + 7)$$$.ExamplesInput
