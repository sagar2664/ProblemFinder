Help him to find an integer $$$n$$$ such that $$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{18}$$$ and $$$n \bmod x = y \bmod n$$$. Here, $$$a \bmod b$$$ denotes the remainder of $$$a$$$ after division by $$$b$$$. If there are multiple such integers, output any. It can be shown that such an integer always exists under the given constraints.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$2 \le x, y \le 10^9$$$, both are even).OutputFor each test case, print a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{18}$$$) that satisfies the condition mentioned in the statement. If there are multiple such integers, output any. It can be shown that such an integer always exists under the given constraints.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$4 \bmod 4 = 8 \bmod 4 = 0$$$.In the second test case, $$$10 \bmod 4 = 2 \bmod 10 = 2$$$.In the third test case, $$$420 \bmod 420 = 420 \bmod 420 = 0$$$.
