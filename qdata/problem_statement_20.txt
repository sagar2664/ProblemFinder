F. Rare Coinstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are $$$n$$$ bags numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th bag contains $$$a_i$$$ golden coins and $$$b_i$$$ silver coins.The value of a gold coin is $$$1$$$. The value of a silver coin is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$, determined for each silver coin independently ($$$0$$$ with probability $$$\frac{1}{2}$$$, $$$1$$$ with probability $$$\frac{1}{2}$$$).You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries. Each query is the following:   $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — calculate the probability that the total value of coins in bags from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is strictly greater than the total value in all other bags. InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of bags and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^6$$$) — the number of gold coins in the $$$i$$$-th bag.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \le b_i \le 10^6$$$) — the number of silver coins in the $$$i$$$-th bag.Next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries. The $$$j$$$-th of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_j$$$ and $$$r_j$$$ ($$$1 \le l_j \le r_j \le n$$$) — the description of the $$$j$$$-th query.Additional constraints on the input:   the sum of the array $$$a$$$ doesn't exceed $$$10^6$$$;  the sum of the array $$$b$$$ doesn't exceed $$$10^6$$$. OutputFor each query, print one integer — the probability that the total value of coins in bags from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is strictly greater than the total value in all other bags, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \cdot y^{-1} \bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \cdot y^{-1} \bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.ExamplesInput
