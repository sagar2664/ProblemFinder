A. Difference Operationstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers.You are allowed to perform this operation any number of times (possibly, zero):   choose an index $$$i$$$ ($$$2 \le i \le n$$$), and change $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i - a_{i-1}$$$. Is it possible to make $$$a_i=0$$$ for all $$$2\le i\le n$$$?InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 100$$$)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 100$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print "YES" (without quotes), if it is possible to change $$$a_i$$$ to $$$0$$$ for all $$$2 \le i \le n$$$, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, the initial array is $$$[5,10]$$$. You can perform $$$2$$$ operations to reach the goal:  Choose $$$i=2$$$, and the array becomes $$$[5,5]$$$.  Choose $$$i=2$$$, and the array becomes $$$[5,0]$$$. In the second test case, the initial array is $$$[1,2,3]$$$. You can perform $$$4$$$ operations to reach the goal:   Choose $$$i=3$$$, and the array becomes $$$[1,2,1]$$$.  Choose $$$i=2$$$, and the array becomes $$$[1,1,1]$$$.  Choose $$$i=3$$$, and the array becomes $$$[1,1,0]$$$.  Choose $$$i=2$$$, and the array becomes $$$[1,0,0]$$$. In the third test case, you can choose indices in the order $$$4$$$, $$$3$$$, $$$2$$$.
