First, Bogocubic fixed an integer $$$n$$$, and then he gave amenotiomoi an integer $$$x$$$ which is initially equal to $$$1$$$.In one move amenotiomoi performs one of the following operations with the same probability:  increase $$$x$$$ by $$$1$$$;  multiply $$$x$$$ by $$$2$$$. Bogocubic wants to find the expected number of moves amenotiomoi has to do to make $$$x$$$ greater than or equal to $$$n$$$. Help him find this number modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.Formally, let $$$M = 998\,244\,353$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$y$$$ that $$$0 \le y < M$$$ and $$$y \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the expected number of moves modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$n\le x$$$ without any operations, so the answer is $$$0$$$.In the second test case, for $$$n = 4$$$, here is the list of all possible sequences of operations and their probabilities:  $$$1\stackrel{+1}{\longrightarrow}2\stackrel{+1}{\longrightarrow}3\stackrel{+1}{\longrightarrow}4$$$, the probability is $$$\frac{1}{8}$$$;  $$$1\stackrel{\times 2}{\longrightarrow}2\stackrel{+1}{\longrightarrow}3\stackrel{+1}{\longrightarrow}4$$$, the probability is $$$\frac{1}{8}$$$;  $$$1\stackrel{+1}{\longrightarrow}2\stackrel{+1}{\longrightarrow}3\stackrel{\times 2}{\longrightarrow}6$$$, the probability is $$$\frac{1}{8}$$$;  $$$1\stackrel{\times 2}{\longrightarrow}2\stackrel{+1}{\longrightarrow}3\stackrel{\times 2}{\longrightarrow}6$$$, the probability is $$$\frac{1}{8}$$$;  $$$1\stackrel{+1}{\longrightarrow}2\stackrel{\times 2}{\longrightarrow}4$$$, the probability is $$$\frac{1}{4}$$$;  $$$1\stackrel{\times 2}{\longrightarrow}2\stackrel{\times 2}{\longrightarrow}4$$$, the probability is $$$\frac{1}{4}$$$. So the expected number of moves is $$$4 \cdot \left(3 \cdot \frac{1}{8}\right) + 2 \cdot \left(2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \right) =\frac{5}{2} \equiv 499122179 \pmod{998244353}$$$. In the third test case, for $$$n = 8$$$, the expected number of moves is $$$\frac{137}{32}\equiv 717488133\pmod{998244353}$$$. In the fourth test case, for $$$n = 15$$$, the expected number of moves is $$$\frac{24977}{4096} \equiv 900515847 \pmod{998244353}$$$.
