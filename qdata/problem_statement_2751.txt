B. Strange Listtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$ to a brand new robot. What the robot does is the following: it iterates over the elements of the array, let the current element be $$$q$$$. If $$$q$$$ is divisible by $$$x$$$, the robot adds $$$x$$$ copies of the integer $$$\frac{q}{x}$$$ to the end of the array, and moves on to the next element. Note that the newly added elements could be processed by the robot later. Otherwise, if $$$q$$$ is not divisible by $$$x$$$, the robot shuts down.Please determine the sum of all values of the array at the end of the process.InputThe first input line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$2 \leq x \leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the value which is used by the robot.The next line contains integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the initial values in the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case output one integer — the sum of all elements at the end of the process.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case the array initially consists of a single element $$$[12]$$$, and $$$x=2$$$. After the robot processes the first element, the array becomes $$$[12, 6, 6]$$$. Then the robot processes the second element, and the array becomes $$$[12, 6, 6, 3, 3]$$$. After the robot processes the next element, the array becomes $$$[12, 6, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3]$$$, and then the robot shuts down, since it encounters an element that is not divisible by $$$x = 2$$$. The sum of the elements in the resulting array is equal to $$$36$$$.In the second test case the array initially contains integers $$$[4, 6, 8, 2]$$$, and $$$x=2$$$. The resulting array in this case looks like $$$ [4, 6, 8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$.
