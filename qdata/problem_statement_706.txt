E. MEX of LCMtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. A positive integer $$$x$$$ is called good if it is impossible to find a subsegment$$$^{\dagger}$$$ of the array such that the least common multiple of all its elements is equal to $$$x$$$.You need to find the smallest good integer.A subsegment$$$^{\dagger}$$$ of the array $$$a$$$ is a set of elements $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r$$$ for some $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$. We will denote such subsegment as $$$[l, r]$$$.InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the smallest good integer.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$4$$$ is a good integer, and it is the smallest one, since the integers $$$1,2,3$$$ appear in the array, which means that there are subsegments of the array of length $$$1$$$ with least common multiples of $$$1,2,3$$$. However, it is impossible to find a subsegment of the array with a least common multiple equal to $$$4$$$.In the second test case, $$$7$$$ is a good integer. The integers $$$1,2,3,4,5$$$ appear explicitly in the array, and the integer $$$6$$$ is the least common multiple of the subsegments $$$[2, 3]$$$ and $$$[1, 3]$$$.In the third test case, $$$1$$$ is a good integer, since the least common multiples for the integer in the subsegments $$$[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2]$$$ are $$$2,6,3$$$, respectively.
