D1. Red-Blue Operations (Easy Version)time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe only difference between easy and hard versions is the maximum values of $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$.You are given an array, consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. Initially, all elements are red.You can apply the following operation to the array multiple times. During the $$$i$$$-th operation, you select an element of the array; then:   if the element is red, it increases by $$$i$$$ and becomes blue;  if the element is blue, it decreases by $$$i$$$ and becomes red. The operations are numbered from $$$1$$$, i. e. during the first operation some element is changed by $$$1$$$ and so on.You are asked $$$q$$$ queries of the following form:   given an integer $$$k$$$, what can the largest minimum in the array be if you apply exactly $$$k$$$ operations to it? Note that the operations don't affect the array between queries, all queries are asked on the initial array $$$a$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 1000$$$) — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).The third line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$k_1, k_2, \dots, k_q$$$ ($$$1 \le k_j \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each query, print a single integer — the largest minimum that the array can have after you apply exactly $$$k$$$ operations to it.ExamplesInput
