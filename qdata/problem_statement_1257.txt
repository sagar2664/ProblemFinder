A. Sumtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$. Determine if one of them is the sum of the other two.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 9261$$$) — the number of test cases.The description of each test case consists of three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$0 \leq a, b, c \leq 20$$$).OutputFor each test case, output "YES" if one of the numbers is the sum of the other two, and "NO" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$1 + 3 = 4$$$.In the second test case, none of the numbers is the sum of the other two.In the third test case, $$$9 + 11 = 20$$$.
