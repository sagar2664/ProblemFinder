C. Product of Three Numberstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given one integer number $$$n$$$. Find three distinct integers $$$a, b, c$$$ such that $$$2 \le a, b, c$$$ and $$$a \cdot b \cdot c = n$$$ or say that it is impossible to do it.If there are several answers, you can print any.You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The next $$$n$$$ lines describe test cases. The $$$i$$$-th test case is given on a new line as one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the answer on it. Print "NO" if it is impossible to represent $$$n$$$ as $$$a \cdot b \cdot c$$$ for some distinct integers $$$a, b, c$$$ such that $$$2 \le a, b, c$$$.Otherwise, print "YES" and any possible such representation.ExampleInput
