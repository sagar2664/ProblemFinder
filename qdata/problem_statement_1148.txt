F. Doremy's Experimental Treetime limit per test2.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputDoremy has an edge-weighted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices whose weights are integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$. She does $$$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$$ experiments on it.In each experiment, Doremy chooses vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$j \leq i$$$ and connects them directly with an edge with weight $$$1$$$. Then, there is exactly one cycle (or self-loop when $$$i=j$$$) in the graph. Doremy defines $$$f(i,j)$$$ as the sum of lengths of shortest paths from every vertex to the cycle.Formally, let $$$\mathrm{dis}_{i,j}(x,y)$$$ be the length of the shortest path between vertex $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ when the edge $$$(i,j)$$$ of weight $$$1$$$ is added, and $$$S_{i,j}$$$ be the set of vertices that are on the cycle when edge $$$(i,j)$$$ is added. Then,$$$$$$ f(i,j)=\sum_{x=1}^{n}\left(\min_{y\in S_{i,j}}\mathrm{dis}_{i,j}(x,y)\right). $$$$$$Doremy writes down all values of $$$f(i,j)$$$ such that $$$1 \leq j \leq i \leq n$$$, then goes to sleep. However, after waking up, she finds that the tree has gone missing. Fortunately, the values of $$$f(i,j)$$$ are still in her notebook, and she knows which $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ they belong to. Given the values of $$$f(i,j)$$$, can you help her restore the tree?It is guaranteed that at least one suitable tree exists.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2000$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain a lower-triangular matrix with $$$i$$$ integers on the $$$i$$$-th line; the $$$j$$$-th integer on the $$$i$$$-th line is $$$f(i,j)$$$ ($$$0 \le f(i,j) \le 2\cdot 10^{15}$$$).It is guaranteed that there exists a tree whose weights are integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^9$$$ such that the values of $$$f(i,j)$$$ of the tree match those given in the input.OutputPrint $$$n-1$$$ lines describing the tree. In the $$$i$$$-th line of the output, output three integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$, $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i,v_i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le w_i \le 10^9$$$), representing an edge $$$(u_i,v_i)$$$ whose weight is $$$w_i$$$.If there are multiple answers, you may output any.All edges must form a tree and all values of $$$f(i,j)$$$ must match those given in the input.ExamplesInput

NoteIn the first test case, the picture below, from left to right, from top to bottom, shows the graph when pairs $$$(1,1)$$$, $$$(1,2)$$$, $$$(1,3)$$$, $$$(2,2)$$$, $$$(2,3)$$$, $$$(3,3)$$$ are connected with an edge, respectively. The nodes colored yellow are on the cycle.
