F. Binary String Partitiontime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's call a string $$$t$$$ consisting of characters 0 and/or 1 beautiful, if either the number of occurrences of character 0 in this string does not exceed $$$k$$$, or the number of occurrences of characters 1 in this string does not exceed $$$k$$$ (or both). For example, if $$$k = 3$$$, the strings 101010, 111, 0, 00000, 1111111000 are beautiful, and the strings 1111110000, 01010101 are not beautiful.You are given a string $$$s$$$. You have to divide it into the minimum possible number of beautiful strings, i. e., find a sequence of strings $$$t_1, t_2, \dots, t_m$$$ such that every $$$t_i$$$ is beautiful, $$$t_1 + t_2 + \dots + t_m = s$$$ (where $$$+$$$ is the concatenation operator), and $$$m$$$ is minimum possible.For every $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$|s|$$$, find the minimum possible number of strings such that $$$s$$$ can be divided into them (i. e. the minimum possible $$$m$$$ in the partition).InputThe only line contains one string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$). Each character of $$$s$$$ is either 0 or 1.OutputPrint $$$|s|$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer should be equal to the minimum number of strings in the partition of $$$s$$$, when $$$k = i$$$.ExamplesInput
