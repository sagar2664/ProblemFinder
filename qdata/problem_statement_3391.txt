F. Phoenix and Memorytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputPhoenix is trying to take a photo of his $$$n$$$ friends with labels $$$1, 2, \dots, n$$$ who are lined up in a row in a special order. But before he can take the photo, his friends get distracted by a duck and mess up their order.Now, Phoenix must restore the order but he doesn't remember completely! He only remembers that the $$$i$$$-th friend from the left had a label between $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ inclusive. Does there exist a unique way to order his friends based of his memory? InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$$$)  — the number of friends.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contain two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le b_i \le n$$$)  — Phoenix's memory of the $$$i$$$-th position from the left.It is guaranteed that Phoenix's memory is valid so there is at least one valid ordering.OutputIf Phoenix can reorder his friends in a unique order, print YES followed by $$$n$$$ integers  — the $$$i$$$-th integer should be the label of the $$$i$$$-th friend from the left.Otherwise, print NO. Then, print any two distinct valid orderings on the following two lines. If are multiple solutions, print any.ExamplesInput
