F. Interesting Sectionstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output  William has an array of non-negative numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. He wants you to find out how many segments $$$l \le r$$$ pass the check. The check is performed in the following manner:   The minimum and maximum numbers are found on the segment of the array starting at $$$l$$$ and ending at $$$r$$$.  The check is considered to be passed if the binary representation of the minimum and maximum numbers have the same number of bits equal to 1. InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$), the size of array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^{18}$$$), the contents of array $$$a$$$.OutputOutput a single number  — the total number of segments that passed the check.ExamplesInput
