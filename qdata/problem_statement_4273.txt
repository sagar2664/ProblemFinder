E. Ehab and the Expected GCD Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLet's define a function $$$f(p)$$$ on a permutation $$$p$$$ as follows. Let $$$g_i$$$ be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_i$$$ (in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length $$$i$$$). Then $$$f(p)$$$ is the number of distinct elements among $$$g_1$$$, $$$g_2$$$, ..., $$$g_n$$$.Let $$$f_{max}(n)$$$ be the maximum value of $$$f(p)$$$ among all permutations $$$p$$$ of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$n$$$.Given an integers $$$n$$$, count the number of permutations $$$p$$$ of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$n$$$, such that $$$f(p)$$$ is equal to $$$f_{max}(n)$$$. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by $$$1000\,000\,007 = 10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe only line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^6$$$) — the length of the permutations.OutputThe only line should contain your answer modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.ExamplesInput

120NoteConsider the second example: these are the permutations of length $$$3$$$:  $$$[1,2,3]$$$, $$$f(p)=1$$$.  $$$[1,3,2]$$$, $$$f(p)=1$$$.  $$$[2,1,3]$$$, $$$f(p)=2$$$.  $$$[2,3,1]$$$, $$$f(p)=2$$$.  $$$[3,1,2]$$$, $$$f(p)=2$$$.  $$$[3,2,1]$$$, $$$f(p)=2$$$. The maximum value $$$f_{max}(3) = 2$$$, and there are $$$4$$$ permutations $$$p$$$ such that $$$f(p)=2$$$.
