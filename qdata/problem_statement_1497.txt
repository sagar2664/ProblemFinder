You have to process queries of three types:  add a point;  remove a point;  calculate the number of beautiful triples consisting of points belonging to the set. InputThe first line contains two integers $$$q$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \le q, d \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries and the parameter for defining if a triple is beautiful, respectively.The second line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_q$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) denoting the queries. The integer $$$a_i$$$ denotes the $$$i$$$-th query in the following way:  if the point $$$a_i$$$ belongs to the set, remove it; otherwise, add it;  after adding or removing the point, print the number of beautiful triples. OutputFor each query, print one integer — the number of beautiful triples after processing the respective query.ExampleInput
