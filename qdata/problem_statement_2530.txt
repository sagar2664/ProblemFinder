To do this, he wants to get a job as a programmer in a big company.There are $$$n$$$ positions in Polycarp's company, numbered starting from one. An employee in position $$$i$$$ earns $$$a[i]$$$ tugriks every day. The higher the position number, the more tugriks the employee receives. Initially, Polycarp gets a position with the number $$$1$$$ and has $$$0$$$ tugriks.Each day Polycarp can do one of two things:   If Polycarp is in the position of $$$x$$$, then he can earn $$$a[x]$$$ tugriks.  If Polycarp is in the position of $$$x$$$ ($$$x < n$$$) and has at least $$$b[x]$$$ tugriks, then he can spend $$$b[x]$$$ tugriks on an online course and move to the position $$$x+1$$$. For example, if $$$n=4$$$, $$$c=15$$$, $$$a=[1, 3, 10, 11]$$$, $$$b=[1, 2, 7]$$$, then Polycarp can act like this:   On the first day, Polycarp is in the $$$1$$$-st position and earns $$$1$$$ tugrik. Now he has $$$1$$$ tugrik;  On the second day, Polycarp is in the $$$1$$$-st position and move to the $$$2$$$-nd position. Now he has $$$0$$$ tugriks;  On the third day, Polycarp is in the $$$2$$$-nd position and earns $$$3$$$ tugriks. Now he has $$$3$$$ tugriks;  On the fourth day, Polycarp is in the $$$2$$$-nd position and is transferred to the $$$3$$$-rd position. Now he has $$$1$$$ tugriks;  On the fifth day, Polycarp is in the $$$3$$$-rd position and earns $$$10$$$ tugriks. Now he has $$$11$$$ tugriks;  On the sixth day, Polycarp is in the $$$3$$$-rd position and earns $$$10$$$ tugriks. Now he has $$$21$$$ tugriks;  Six days later, Polycarp can buy himself a new computer. Find the minimum number of days after which Polycarp will be able to buy himself a new computer.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le c \le 10^9$$$) — the number of positions in the company and the cost of a new computer.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1 \le a_2 \le \ldots \le a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).The third line of each test case contains $$$n - 1$$$ integer $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n-1}$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum number of days after which Polycarp will be able to buy a new computer.ExampleInput
