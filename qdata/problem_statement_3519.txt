Find any such $$$2$$$ positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that $$$GCD(a,b)+LCM(a,b)=x$$$.As a reminder, $$$GCD(a,b)$$$ is the greatest integer that divides both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. Similarly, $$$LCM(a,b)$$$ is the smallest integer such that both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ divide it.It's guaranteed that the solution always exists. If there are several such pairs $$$(a, b)$$$, you can output any of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le 100)$$$  — the number of testcases.Each testcase consists of one line containing a single integer, $$$x$$$ $$$(2 \le x \le 10^9)$$$.OutputFor each testcase, output a pair of positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 10^9)$$$ such that $$$GCD(a,b)+LCM(a,b)=x$$$. It's guaranteed that the solution always exists. If there are several such pairs $$$(a, b)$$$, you can output any of them.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first testcase of the sample, $$$GCD(1,1)+LCM(1,1)=1+1=2$$$.In the second testcase of the sample, $$$GCD(6,4)+LCM(6,4)=2+12=14$$$.
