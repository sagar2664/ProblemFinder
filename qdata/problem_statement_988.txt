Note that you do not need to minimize or maximize the length of the arrays.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains only one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the maximum value of $$$\sum a_i \cdot p_i$$$.ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case, $$$100 = 10^2$$$ so that $$$a = [10]$$$, $$$p = [2]$$$ when $$$\sum a_i \cdot p_i$$$ hits the maximum value $$$10\cdot 2 = 20$$$. Also, $$$a = [100]$$$, $$$p = [1]$$$ does not work since $$$100$$$ is not made of distinct prime factors.In the second test case, we can consider $$$10$$$ as $$$10^1$$$, so $$$a = [10]$$$, $$$p = [1]$$$. Notice that when $$$10 = 2^1\cdot 5^1$$$, $$$\sum a_i \cdot p_i = 7$$$.
