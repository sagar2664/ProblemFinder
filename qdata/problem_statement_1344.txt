A. Two Elevatorstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputVlad went into his appartment house entrance, now he is on the $$$1$$$-th floor. He was going to call the elevator to go up to his apartment.There are only two elevators in his house. Vlad knows for sure that:  the first elevator is currently on the floor $$$a$$$ (it is currently motionless),  the second elevator is located on floor $$$b$$$ and goes to floor $$$c$$$ ($$$b \ne c$$$). Please note, if $$$b=1$$$, then the elevator is already leaving the floor $$$1$$$ and Vlad does not have time to enter it. If you call the first elevator, it will immediately start to go to the floor $$$1$$$. If you call the second one, then first it will reach the floor $$$c$$$ and only then it will go to the floor $$$1$$$. It takes $$$|x - y|$$$ seconds for each elevator to move from floor $$$x$$$ to floor $$$y$$$.Vlad wants to call an elevator that will come to him faster. Help him choose such an elevator.InputThe first line of the input contains the only $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.This is followed by $$$t$$$ lines, three integers each $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b, c \le 10^8$$$, $$$b \ne c$$$) — floor numbers described in the statement.OutputOutput $$$t$$$ numbers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As an answer, output:  $$$1$$$, if it is better to call the first elevator;  $$$2$$$, if it is better to call the second one;  $$$3$$$, if it doesn't matter which elevator to call (both elevators will arrive in the same time).

NoteIn the first test case of the example, the first elevator is already on the floor of $$$1$$$.In the second test case of the example, when called, the elevators would move as follows:  At the time of the call, the first elevator is on the floor of $$$3$$$, and the second one is on the floor of $$$1$$$, but is already going to another floor;  in $$$1$$$ second after the call, the first elevator would be on the floor $$$2$$$, the second one would also reach the floor $$$2$$$ and now can go to the floor $$$1$$$;  in $$$2$$$ seconds, any elevator would reach the floor $$$1$$$. In the third test case of the example, the first elevator will arrive in $$$2$$$ seconds, and the second in $$$1$$$.
