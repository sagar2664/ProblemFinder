C. Decreasing Stringtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputRecall that string $$$a$$$ is lexicographically smaller than string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$ (and $$$a \ne b$$$), or there exists an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le \min(|a|, |b|)$$$) such that $$$a_i < b_i$$$, and for any index $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j < i$$$) $$$a_j = b_j$$$.Consider a sequence of strings $$$s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$$$, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters. String $$$s_1$$$ is given explicitly, and all other strings are generated according to the following rule: to obtain the string $$$s_i$$$, a character is removed from string $$$s_{i-1}$$$ in such a way that string $$$s_i$$$ is lexicographically minimal.For example, if $$$s_1 = \mathrm{dacb}$$$, then string $$$s_2 = \mathrm{acb}$$$, string $$$s_3 = \mathrm{ab}$$$, string $$$s_4 = \mathrm{a}$$$.After that, we obtain the string $$$S = s_1 + s_2 + \dots + s_n$$$ ($$$S$$$ is the concatenation of all strings $$$s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$$$).You need to output the character in position $$$pos$$$ of the string $$$S$$$ (i. e. the character $$$S_{pos}$$$).InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ — the number of test cases ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$).Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the string $$$s_1$$$ ($$$1 \le |s_1| \le 10^6$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The second line contains the integer $$$pos$$$ ($$$1 \le pos \le \frac{|s_1| \cdot (|s_1| +1)}{2}$$$). You may assume that $$$n$$$ is equal to the length of the given string ($$$n = |s_1|$$$).Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$|s_1|$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, print the answer — the character that is at position $$$pos$$$ in string $$$S$$$. Note that the answers between different test cases are not separated by spaces or line breaks.ExampleInput
