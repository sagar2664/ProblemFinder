D. Intervals of Intervalstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputLittle D is a friend of Little C who loves intervals very much instead of number "$$$3$$$".Now he has $$$n$$$ intervals on the number axis, the $$$i$$$-th of which is $$$[a_i,b_i]$$$.Only the $$$n$$$ intervals can not satisfy him. He defines the value of an interval of intervals $$$[l,r]$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are both integers) as the total length of the union of intervals from the $$$l$$$-th to the $$$r$$$-th.He wants to select exactly $$$k$$$ different intervals of intervals such that the sum of their values is maximal. Please help him calculate the maximal sum.InputFirst line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq \min\{\frac{n(n+1)}{2},10^9\}$$$) — the number of intervals Little D has and the number of intervals of intervals he will select.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$, the $$$i$$$-th line of the $$$n$$$ lines describing the $$$i$$$-th interval ($$$1 \leq a_i < b_i \leq 10^9$$$).OutputPrint one integer — the maximal sum of values Little D can get.ExamplesInput2 11 32 4Output3Input3 31 45 73 6Output15NoteFor the first example, Little D will select $$$[1,2]$$$, the union of the first interval and the second interval is $$$[1,4]$$$, whose length is $$$3$$$.For the second example, Little D will select $$$[1,2]$$$, $$$[2,3]$$$ and $$$[1,3]$$$, the answer is $$$5+6+4=15$$$.
