C. awoo's Favorite Problemtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. Each character in both string is 'a', 'b' or 'c'.In one move, you can perform one of the following actions:   choose an occurrence of "ab" in $$$s$$$ and replace it with "ba";  choose an occurrence of "bc" in $$$s$$$ and replace it with "cb". You are allowed to perform an arbitrary amount of moves (possibly, zero). Can you change string $$$s$$$ to make it equal to string $$$t$$$?InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$.The second line contains string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Each character is 'a', 'b' or 'c'.The third line contains string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Each character is 'a', 'b' or 'c'.The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each testcase, print "YES" if you can change string $$$s$$$ to make it equal to string $$$t$$$ by performing an arbitrary amount of moves (possibly, zero). Otherwise, print "NO".ExampleInput
