This is also guaranteed for the sum of $$$q$$$ values.OutputFor each test case print a line with $$$q$$$ numbers — the answers to the queries.ExampleInput

NoteFor the first test case, let's analyze each pair of numbers separately:   pair $$$(a_1,a_2)$$$: $$$a_1 + a_2 = 4$$$, $$$a_1 \cdot a_2 = 3$$$  pair $$$(a_1,a_3)$$$: $$$a_1 + a_3 = 3$$$, $$$a_1 \cdot a_3 = 2$$$  pair $$$(a_2,a_3)$$$: $$$a_2 + a_3 = 5$$$, $$$a_2 \cdot a_3 = 6$$$  From this, we can see that for the first query, the pair $$$(a_1,a_3)$$$ is suitable, for the second query, it is $$$(a_2,a_3)$$$, and there are no suitable pairs for the third and fourth queries.In the second test case, all combinations of pairs are suitable.
