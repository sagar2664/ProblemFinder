E. Two Round Dancestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOne day, $$$n$$$ people ($$$n$$$ is an even number) met on a plaza and made two round dances, each round dance consists of exactly $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ people. Your task is to find the number of ways $$$n$$$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ people. Each person should belong to exactly one of these two round dances.Round dance is a dance circle consisting of $$$1$$$ or more people. Two round dances are indistinguishable (equal) if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant. For example, round dances $$$[1, 3, 4, 2]$$$, $$$[4, 2, 1, 3]$$$ and $$$[2, 1, 3, 4]$$$ are indistinguishable.For example, if $$$n=2$$$ then the number of ways is $$$1$$$: one round dance consists of the first person and the second one of the second person.For example, if $$$n=4$$$ then the number of ways is $$$3$$$. Possible options:  one round dance — $$$[1,2]$$$, another — $$$[3,4]$$$;  one round dance — $$$[2,4]$$$, another — $$$[3,1]$$$;  one round dance — $$$[4,1]$$$, another — $$$[3,2]$$$. Your task is to find the number of ways $$$n$$$ people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ people.InputThe input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 20$$$), $$$n$$$ is an even number.OutputPrint one integer — the number of ways to make two round dances. It is guaranteed that the answer fits in the $$$64$$$-bit integer data type.ExamplesInput2Output1Input4Output3Input8Output1260Input20Output12164510040883200
