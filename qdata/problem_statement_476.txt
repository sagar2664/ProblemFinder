B. The Corridor or There and Back Againtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are in a corridor that extends infinitely to the right, divided into square rooms. You start in room $$$1$$$, proceed to room $$$k$$$, and then return to room $$$1$$$. You can choose the value of $$$k$$$. Moving to an adjacent room takes $$$1$$$ second.Additionally, there are $$$n$$$ traps in the corridor: the $$$i$$$-th trap is located in room $$$d_i$$$ and will be activated $$$s_i$$$ seconds after you enter the room $$$\boldsymbol{d_i}$$$. Once a trap is activated, you cannot enter or exit a room with that trap.  A schematic representation of a possible corridor and your path to room $$$k$$$ and back. Determine the maximum value of $$$k$$$ that allows you to travel from room $$$1$$$ to room $$$k$$$ and then return to room $$$1$$$ safely.For instance, if $$$n=1$$$ and $$$d_1=2, s_1=2$$$, you can proceed to room $$$k=2$$$ and return safely (the trap will activate at the moment $$$1+s_1=1+2=3$$$, it can't prevent you to return back). But if you attempt to reach room $$$k=3$$$, the trap will activate at the moment $$$1+s_1=1+2=3$$$, preventing your return (you would attempt to enter room $$$2$$$ on your way back at second $$$3$$$, but the activated trap would block you). Any larger value for $$$k$$$ is also not feasible. Thus, the answer is $$$k=2$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case description contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of traps.The following $$$n$$$ lines of each test case description present two integers $$$d_i$$$ and $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \le d_i, s_i \le 200$$$) — the parameters of a trap (you must leave room $$$d_i$$$ strictly before $$$s_i$$$ seconds have passed since entering this room). It's possible for multiple traps to occupy a single room (the values of $$$d_i$$$ can be repeated).OutputFor each test case, print the maximum value of $$$k$$$ that allows you to travel to room $$$k$$$ and return to room $$$1$$$ without encountering an active trap.ExampleInput

NoteThe first test case is explained in the problem statement above.In the second test case, the second trap prevents you from achieving $$$k\ge6$$$. If $$$k\ge6$$$, the second trap will activate at the moment $$$3+s_2=3+3=6$$$ (the time you enter room $$$4$$$ plus $$$s_2$$$). In the case of $$$k\ge6$$$, you will return to room $$$4$$$ at time $$$7$$$ or later. The trap will be active at that time. It can be shown that room $$$k=5$$$ can be reached without encountering an active trap.In the third test case, you can make it to room $$$299$$$ and then immediately return to room $$$1$$$.
