G. Anya and the Mysterious Stringtime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAnya received a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ brought from Rome. The string $$$s$$$ consists of lowercase Latin letters and at first glance does not raise any suspicions. An instruction was attached to the string.Start of the instruction.A palindrome is a string that reads the same from left to right and right to left. For example, the strings "anna", "aboba", "level" are palindromes, while the strings "gorilla", "banan", "off" are not.A substring $$$[l \ldots r]$$$ of string $$$s$$$ is a string $$$s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_{r-1} s_r$$$. For example, the substring $$$[4 \ldots 6]$$$ of the string "generation" is the string "era".A string is called beautiful if it does not contain a substring of length at least two that is a palindrome. For example, the strings "fox", "abcdef", and "yioy" are beautiful, while the strings "xyxx", "yikjkitrb" are not.When an integer $$$x$$$ is added to the character $$$s_i$$$, it is replaced $$$x$$$ times with the next character in the alphabet, with "z" being replaced by "a".When an integer $$$x$$$ is added to the substring $$$[l, r]$$$ of string $$$s$$$, it becomes the string $$$s_1 s_2 \ldots s_{l-1} (s_l + x) (s_{l+1} + x) \ldots (s_{r-1} + x) (s_r + x) s_{r+1} \ldots s_n$$$. For example, when the substring $$$[2, 4]$$$ of the string "abazaba" is added with the number $$$6$$$, the resulting string is "ahgfaba".End of the instruction.After reading the instruction, Anya resigned herself to the fact that she has to answer $$$m$$$ queries. The queries can be of two types:  Add the number $$$x$$$ to the substring $$$[l \ldots r]$$$ of string $$$s$$$.  Determine whether the substring $$$[l \ldots r]$$$ of string $$$s$$$ is beautiful. InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) - the number of test cases.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) - the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the number of queries.The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.The next $$$m$$$ lines contain the queries:  $$$1$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$, $$$1 \le x \le 10^9$$$) - description of a query of the first type;  $$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) - description of a query of the second type. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each query of the second type, output "YES" if the substring $$$[l \ldots r]$$$ of string $$$s$$$ is beautiful, otherwise output "NO".You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers).ExampleInput

NoteIn the first test case of the first test, the following happens:  tedubcyyxopz: the string edub is beautiful;  tedubcyyxopz $$$\to$$$ tedwdeaaxopz;  tedwdeaaxopz: the string tedwdea is not beautiful as it contains the palindrome edwde;  tedwdeaaxopz $$$\to$$$ terkreaaxopz;  terkreaaxopz $$$\to$$$ terkreaaarsz;  terkreaaarsz $$$\to$$$ terkreaaaasz;  terkreaaaasz: the string kreaaaa is not beautiful as it contains the palindrome aaaa;  terkreaaaasz: the string asz is beautiful.
