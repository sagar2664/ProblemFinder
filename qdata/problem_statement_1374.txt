F. L-shapestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAn L-shape is a figure on gridded paper that looks like the first four pictures below. An L-shape contains exactly three shaded cells (denoted by *), which can be rotated in any way.  You are given a rectangular grid. Determine if it contains L-shapes only, where L-shapes can't touch an edge or corner. More formally:   Each shaded cell in the grid is part of exactly one L-shape, and  no two L-shapes are adjacent by edge or corner. For example, the last two grids in the picture above do not satisfy the condition because the two L-shapes touch by corner and edge, respectively.InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, m \leq 50$$$) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, each containing $$$m$$$ characters. Each of these characters is either '.' or '*' — an empty cell or a shaded cell, respectively.OutputFor each test case, output "YES" if the grid is made up of L-shape that don't share edges or corners, and "NO" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).ExampleInput
